Jurgen Klopp has confirmed Mario Balotelli is not part of his plans at Liverpool.
The Italian striker has made just 16 Premier League appearances, scoring one goal, since joining the Merseyside club in August 2014 for a fee of £16m.
He was shipped out on loan to AC Milan last season but struggled to make an impact at the San Siro and has now returned to England.
The 25-year-old has joined Klopp’s first-team squad for pre-season training, but did not feature in the first warm-up game of the summer against Tranmere on Friday.
And, while Klopp has been impressed by Balotelli’s application and talent in training, he has told the forward it is best for him to move on.
Speaking to the Liverpool Echo, the German said: “Since he has been back here, he’s been a good guy and I can’t say anything different than that. It’s not that he’s come back and said: ‘who’s the boss, I’m the boss, no sorry it’s you’. It’s not been that at all.
“Everything’s been good, it’s all OK, and now he’s here we will do everything we can to get him fit.
“When we have done the crossing, heading and stuff (in training), he’s been world class. But this is not a situation where he should be battling with other players like this for one position so it’s clear we need a solution.
“There will be a club around who would be happy to have a new Mario Balotelli if you like.
“I have spoken clearly to the player about that. I know we can’t talk about a lot of things because one agent says ‘we want to stay’, and another says ‘we have had 10 offers so we have to leave’.
“But in this case it’s obvious. It’s now time to make decisions and I try to help Mario to get in the best shape he can be in and we will see what happens.”
