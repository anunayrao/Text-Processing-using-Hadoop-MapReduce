The Hall of Fame was created in the late 1990s to recognize people from the Rhode Island golf community who have made significant contributions to the game of golf. The first induction took place in 2001, with subsequent inductions taking place every two years. Thirty-six people have been honored through 2009. 
Martha Wilkinson Kirouac won the RIWGA Women’s Amateur Championship three times (1974-75-77); the RIGA Mixed Championship four times; the 1975 New England Women’s Amateur Championship; the 1970 U.S. Women’s Amateur Championship; the National Women’s Collegiate Championship and the Trans-Mississippi Women’s Amateur Championship.

She also served as captain of the 2004 USA Curtis Cup Team and is a member of the USGA Women’s Committee. 
Abrams won the RIGA Amateur Championship twice, in 1972 against Ronnie Quinn and in 1975 over Charlie Hayes. He was a finalist in the Amateur Championship in 1964 and 1976, and won the 1975 State Mixed Championship with Estelle Wolfson of Ledgemont Country Club. He has continued his dedication to golf with his off-course activities in golf course construction and management.

His teams dominated Division II golf for five decades, followed by continued success at the Division I level. His teams captured the Northeast-10 title 20 of 27 times. He coached hundreds of young men, many of whom became head or assistant professionals at courses across the nation.
