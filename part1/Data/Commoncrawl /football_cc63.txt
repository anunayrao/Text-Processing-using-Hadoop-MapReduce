Stoke have completed the signing of Aston Villa midfielder Stephen Ireland, while Manchester City prospect John Guidetti has joined on loan.
The Villans star had been on a season-long loan at the Britannia Stadium but has now agreed a permanent deal with Mark Hughes’ side.
“Stephen is a talented footballer and has shown what he’s capable of since he joined us. We’re delighted to have made his switch a permanent arrangement as it also gives us the opportunity to bring in another player on loan if necessary.”
Man City youngster Guidetti has agreed a loan with the Potters, as he looks to make an impression on the Premier League.
The highly-rated Guidetti, 21, joined City at the age of 16 but his progress at the club has been hampered by illness and injuries.
“We wanted to try and add different options to our attacking threat and John will certainly do that,” Hughes added. “He’s someone who if you get him in the right areas will make the most of opportunities that come his way because he’s a natural goal-scorer. There were several clubs who were interested in taking him on loan and we’re delighted that he has chosen to join us.”
