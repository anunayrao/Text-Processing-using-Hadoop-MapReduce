Stoke boss Mark Hughes has confirmed striker Kenwyne Jones has been fined for refusing to play against Liverpool.
The Trinidad and Tobago international was missing from the squad for last Sunday’s Premier League match at the Britannia Stadium, as the Potters crashed to a 5-3 defeat.
Subsequent reports in the press claimed Jones had sent a text message to Hughes on the night before the contest to say he was unavailable for selection and, as a result, had been fined the equivalent of two weeks’ wages.
Hughes has now confirmed those reports are true and has revealed the 29-year-old will play no part in Saturday’s clash at Crystal Palace.
“I was disappointed and Kenwyne has been fined because it is not something that should happen,” he said.
“We spoke on Monday just to get an understanding of why it happened, so we had that meeting. He has been in this week training and we get on with it.
“He won’t be involved this weekend, that would be fair to say, because maybe the events of last weekend are still in his mind.
“But moving forward, we’ll have to wait and see.”
Hughes believes Jones’ no-show may be down to speculation over his future, with Everton rumoured to be keen on signing him this month.
But the Welshman insists the club have yet to receive any enquires over the unhappy hitman.
“Maybe that’s the problem – that maybe people are telling him there are clubs in for him,” said Hughes.
“We’ve had no contact from anybody in this window, so maybe the information isn’t what it seems from the outside.
“But we’ll have to wait and see. The transfer window is open and a lot of things happen in a window.
“We’ll have to bide our time. But it is unfortunate – none of us saw it coming, so we are disappointed.”
