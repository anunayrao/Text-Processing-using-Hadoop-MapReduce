	John Hartson has urged the Football Association of Wales to take a chance on him and name him as the country's new national boss.

	Brian Flynn is currently in temporary charge of the side following John Toshack's departure but Hartson, who won 51 caps for Wales, would love the chance to take the reins.

	The 35-year-old is the same age as Mark Hughes was when the Welsh placed him in charge, and he would relish the chance to follow in the ex-Manchester United and Chelsea star's footsteps

	The former Arsenal, West Ham and Celtic striker told Hawksbee & Jacobs: "In any walk of life you need a chance, and it’s the same with management.

	"Some players finish and go straight into it, like Roy Keane at Sunderland and Mark Hughes with Wales. They were guys who’d had wonderful careers and were great players, but they got a break.

	"Neil Lennon got a break at Celtic. He hadn’t been a manager before. As a manager you need someone to go ‘hey, I’ll go with him, I’ll give him a chance’ and maybe I haven’t quite had that yet because people were a bit concerned about my illness and it made them think twice.

	"Having played at the level I played at, and with the managers I played for, I feel I know what to do and what systems to play and I’d like to have a go at it.

	"It’s not an obsession. I’m 35 years of age and, if it doesn’t happen for four or five more years, I’ll still be a young man. So at some stage I’d like to have that chance."
