The win is Federer's 97th career title, with the veteran needing just 55 minutes to sweep aside Dimitrov 6-2 6-2 on Sunday.

Federer never looked back after grabbing an early lead, hitting 15 winners and converting four of eight break chances to snuff out any chances Dimitrov had to cause an upset.
The Swiss ace will officially return to the summit of the ATP rankings for the first time in more than five years on Monday.
Federer's title win in Rotterdam is his third at the tournament, having beaten current coach Ivan Ljubicic in 2005 and Juan Martin del Potro in 2012.

"It's definitely one of those weeks I will never forget in my life," Federer said after the match.
"It's unbelievable to get my 97th title and get back to World No. 1. It's very special."

Humble as ever, Federer conceded Dimitrov was far from his best, but was happy he could control the tempo.
"I was expecting it to be tough today. Grigor is a great player and a great athlete and he's been playing super well in recent months," Federer said. 
"I thought that this wasn't going to be the result, but he looked to be struggling a bit and I never looked back. I was able to execute my tennis the way I wanted to. I'm very happy."
