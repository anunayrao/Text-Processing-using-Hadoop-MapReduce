Besiktas could offer Liverpool misfit Mario Balotelli a route out of Anfield after their president expressed a desire to sign the Italy international.
Fikret Orman believes the 25-year-old, who did not travel with the Reds for their tour of the United States after being deemed surplus to requirements, could be a good fit for the Istanbul-based club.
He admits, however, had it not been for Balotelli’s reputation for being difficult they would not stand a chance of attracting him.
“Mario Balotelli is the type of footballer that our fans can associate themselves with,” he told Turkish magazine Fanatik. “I’m pretty sure he would attract great attention.
“To be fair, if he wasn’t deemed as a trouble-maker, he wouldn’t be rumoured to be joining us.
“But we can show some effort and create solutions for Balotelli’s infamous troubles. I think he can change with the attention and care he’ll receive in Turkey.
“In short, we want Mario Balotelli and he wants us too.”
