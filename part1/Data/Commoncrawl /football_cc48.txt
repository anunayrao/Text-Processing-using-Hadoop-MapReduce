Turkish duo Galatasaray and Fenerbahce are battling it out to sign Chelsea outcast Christian Atsu.
There were high hopes for the forward when he arrived from Porto in September 2013 but he has failed to establish himself in west London.
The 24-year-old has never made a senior appearance for the Blues and has been sent on a string of loan moves.
Last season he joined fellow Premier League side Bournemouth but returned after six months having never appeared in a top-flight game.
He fared slightly better at Malaga during the second half of last term, scoring twice in 11 LaLiga outings.
He was not included in Chelseaâ€™s squad for the pre-season tour of the USA as he plots his next move.
According to Fotospor, fierce Istanbul rivals Galatasaray and Fenerbahce want to lure him to the Turkish Super Lig.
They are both lining up loan approaches for the Ghanaian, who is under contract at Stamford Bridge until 2018, while Malaga retain an interest in re-signing him.
