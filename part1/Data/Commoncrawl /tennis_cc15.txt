The 22-year-old's world ranking has slipped six places to 19th in recent weeks with shoulder and hip complaints hampering his transition to the clay court.

But despite these set backs, Kyrgios has demonstrated renewed mental toughness and is determined to give the French Open his all.
"I'm always going to be confident," Kyrgios said.
"I haven't had the best luck in the last couple of weeks.
"Obviously my body has been letting me down a little bit so I'm just trying to get that right before I go out there and play.
"I'm doing everything I can to get ready for my first round."
Kyrgios will start his French Open campaign against 33-year-old German Philipp Kohlschreiber on Sunday with a third round match against French favourite Jo-Wilfried-Tsonga awaiting him should they both advance.
