Fulham head coach Rene Meulensteen does not believe Dimitar Berbatov has any extra incentive to impress against Arsenal when the Cottagers head to the Emirates this weekend.
The Bulgarian striker, who is out of contract in the summer, has been heavily linked with a January move to Arsenal due to Arsene Wenger’s shortage of forward options.
But Meulensteen insists the 32-year-old is fully focused on lifting Fulham away from their relegation battle and will not have anything else on his mind when they travel to north London on Saturday.
When asked about Berbatov’s state of mind ahead of the fixture, Meulensteen said: “He’s a Fulham player and that’s how we prepare. We’ve had no problem at all.
“Why am I so confident? Because I know him, I know how he is. Berba sees this as an important game for Fulham, which has become even more important because of the result against Sunderland (a 4-1 defeat).
“It’s going to be difficult enough – look at the form that Arsenal are in – so I am not thinking about that for one minute, and I am sure he won’t.”
