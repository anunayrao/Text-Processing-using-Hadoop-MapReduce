Two titles, one day.
Nine hours after she stepped foot on Centre Court to win her fifth Wimbledon singles crown, Serena Williams teamed with her sister Venus to win their fifth Wimbledon doubles title. The sisters defeated Andrea Hlavackova and Lucie Hradecka, 7-5, 6-4 in an indoor match that ended just before Centre Court's 11 p.m. curfew.
The victory came in Venus and Serena's first tournament together in two years. They entered as a warm-up for the upcoming Summer Olympics, in which they'll enter as two-time defending gold medalists.
It was the sister's 14th Grand Slam doubles title, the third most in history. In each of their five championships at Wimbledon, one of them also hoisted the Venus Rosewater Dish in the singles competition, as Serena did on Saturday afternoon.
"[The day was] very long," Serena said after the match. "I was just happy to do it with singles and continue it with doubles."
After Serena set the Wimbledon record for most tournament aces, it was fitting that her sister ended their doubles match on an ace.
"I felt like it was my second match too," Venus joked afterward, referring to the tense moments she spent watching Serena defeat Agnieszka Radwanka in the single final.
