Arsenal are ready to make an improved offer of £33.5million for Lyon star Alexandre Lacazette, according to reports in France.
It was revealed on Tuesday that the Gunners have already had a £29.3million bid knocked back as they look to land a new striker this summer.
But, according to L’Equipe, Arsenal are in the process of putting together a new package which would be worth £33.5million.
Despite being told by Lyon that Lacazette is irreplaceable and one of the main leaders in the team, Arsenal are refusing to give up in their pursuit.
The club have already failed in attempts to land Leicester City forward Jamie Vardy and Napoli hitman Gonzalo Higuain, who has instead joined Juventus.
Arsenal are determined not to miss out on another target in Lacazette, but Lyon’s reluctance to sell is likely to see the player’s price tag inflate.
