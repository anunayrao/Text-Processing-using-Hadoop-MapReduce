The Volunteers (2-0) host Louisiana Tech on Saturday for homecoming before returning to Southeastern Conference play against No. 10 Auburn at home and at No. 3 Georgia.
Head coach Phillip Fulmer compared losing Simon to the loss of tailback Jamal Lewis in 1998, a season that ended with the Vols as national champs. 
"But in the case of Jamal, other people stepped up and played really well for us," Fulmer said Tuesday. "That needs to be the case this time. I think it will be." 
It's the third major injury for Simon, a junior. "It's not going to break my spirits," Simon said. He said he is consulting with doctors about surgery options. 
He injured his right knee in a high school all-star game and had to redshirt his freshman season at Tennessee while recovering. In 2002 he broke his ankle and missed most of the season. 
Briefly:
·Maryland will put its new No. 1 ranking in the NSCAA/Adidas men's soccer coaches' poll to the test today with a game at William and Mary. The only other time the Terrapins (5-0-1) have been atop the rankings was a three-week stretch last September. Defending national champ Indiana fell from the top spot to 10th after two losses last weekend.
·Services are Friday in Monterey, Calif., for Pete Cutino, who coached eight national champion water polo teams during 26 seasons at the University of California. Cutino, 71, died Sunday. He also coached the USA's water polo team in the 1976 Olympics. The Peter J. Cutino Award was established in his honor and is given annually to the nation's top male and female collegiate water polo players. 
·Aaron Richardson, 18, a walk-on football player at Bowling Green who died last week after becoming ill at practice, died of a condition related to sickle cell disease, Wood County (Ohio) Coroner Douglas Hess said Tuesday. He said Richardson didn't list sickle cell on his medical records. It is possible for people to carry the trait for years and not know it until they have a health crisis, Hess said. 
·Keenan Burton, Kentucky's second-leading returning receiver, will miss the rest of the season because of a hairline fracture in his wrist. The team's leading returning receiver, Tommy Cook, already was out for the season with a knee injury. 
·No. 24 Iowa (2-1) will be without starting offensive lineman David Walker for the rest of the season after he suffered a torn right triceps Saturday in the loss at Arizona State.
