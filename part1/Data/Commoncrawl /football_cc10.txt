Wigan Athletic boss Uwe Rosler has hinted Manchester United will allow Nick Powell to complete his season-long loan at the DW Stadium amid speculation David Moyes wants to recall the England Under-21 ace.
Powell has excelled since moving to the Championship club earlier this season, scoring ten goals in all competitions.
The 19-year-old’s displays at Wigan, combined with United’s mixed performances, have lead to suggestions in some quarters that Moyes will bring the former Crewe man back early to address his own midfield issues.
But Rosler is confident United will allow Powell to see out the season at the DW Stadium.
He said: “We’ll talk again [with David Moyes] in the last week of January, but I think everyone is happy.”
