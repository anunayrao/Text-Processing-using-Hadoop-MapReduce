The last few months of 2016 witnessed some the coming of age of a few of the tour's emerging talents as well as the re-emergence of some familiar faces battling it out for the last few places at the BNP Paribas WTA Finals Singapore presented by SC Global.
With a number of leading stars taking a well-earned break in the weeks following the US Open, the path was clear for the WTA's less familiar faces to make some noise, Océane Dodin, Christina McHale and Lara Arruabarrena obliging with victories at the International events in Québec City, Tokyo and Seoul.

Kvitova Shines In China
Up at Premier level, there was also success for Caroline Wozniacki and Petra Kvitova, who walked away with the spoils at the Toray Pan Pacific Open and Dongfeng Motor Wuhan Open. Both had endured frustrating 2016 campaigns, but provided reminders of their considerable talents by accounting for a number of higher-ranked rivals.
Kvitova was particularly impressive in Wuhan, coming through a match-of-the-year contender against World No.1 Angelique Kerber before romping towards the silverware. A few weeks later, she would return to China to add one final flourish, seeing off a number of the WTA's brightest young talents to win the Huajin Securities WTA Elite Trophy Zhuhai.

Radwanska Reclaims Beijing Crown
At the final Premier Mandatory event of the year, the China Open, Agnieszka Radwanska reclaimed the trophy she won five years earlier by derailing a Top 10-bound Johanna Konta in a one-sided final. Over in the indoor halls of Europe, there were titles for Monica Niculescu, Dominika Cibulkova and Svetlana Kuznetsova in Luxembourg, Linz and Moscow. The latter pair's success sealed their spots at the season's grand finale in Singapore.
