Kyrgios, who has been under fire since his Stan Wawrinka "Kokkinakis banged your girlfriend" sledge takes on Andy Murray in the first round of singles action, but will team up with Bouchard for the first time in the mixed doubles.
Asked whether she had any reservations about pairing up with tennis' new bad-boy, Bouchard said: "None at all.
"He's a great up and coming player and really interesting and at the end of the day he's good for the game and I think he brings something different.
"He's energetic and charismatic and that's a really unique thing that we don't have so much on the tour so I think we need people like him on the tour."
The Nike stablemates recently appeared in a Steal the Show campaign in New York in the lead-up to the US Open and both have attracted their fair share of criticism since bursting onto the scene over the last few years.
In 2014, Bouchard became the first Canadian to make the Wimbledon final but has lost form this season and has been accused of being a "spoiled brat" after refusing to shake hands with a Fed Cup opponent.
Despite the Wawrinka sledge, Kyrgios and Thanassi Kokkinakis have patched things up and will compete in the men's doubles.
