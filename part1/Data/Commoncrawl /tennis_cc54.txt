Former French Open doubles champion Pam Shriver says the 2017 field at Roland Garros is the most open she has ever seen.
"I think there are so many possibilities in the works," Shriver told a conference call, according to Reuters.
"I've seen some draws that are wide open on the women's side but I've never seen a situation like this."
And Shriver thinks a veteran could spring a surprise in Paris.
"Venus coming off what she did at the Australian Open, getting to her first grand slam final since she knew she had the auto-immune syndrome (Sjogren's Syndrome), and now knowing that her sister is not in the draw. Can she win it? Why not?
"She is a more capable claycourt player than most people think and when you consider the big hitters that have won in the women's game, [Maria] Sharapova twice in the last few years and [Garbiñe] Muguruza last year, Venus is definitely one of the possibilities."
