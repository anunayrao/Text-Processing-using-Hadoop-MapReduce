Neymar's theatrics are not just for football players any more.
The Brazil star's rather dramatic reaction to a Miguel Layun cleat to the leg in the Selecao's 2-0 round of 16 win over Mexico has drawn plenty of attention.
Since, Neymar has seen his nation eliminated from the World Cup in the quarter-finals, but his infamous moment live on, as the #NeymarChallenge makes the rounds on the internet.
The challenge has seen people either imitate Neymar's reaction after the incident, or add the clip of him rolling to various situations for comedic effect.
The former was on display at Wimbledon, the third of tennis' annual Grand Slam events.

In a third-round senior doubles match on Thursday, Jonas Bjorkman was struck in the back by a ball hit by partner Todd Woodbridge.
Bjorkman was fine, and laughed about the incident, along with his partner and the crowd.
However, after a few moments, Bjorkman decided he wanted to have some more fun at the expense of Neymar, as he grabbed his stomach and then rolled around to the center of the court.
One of Bjorkman's opponents, Mansour Bahrami decided to get in on the act, as he climbed over the net at Bjorkman's dramatic insistence, as he waved for help.

Bahrami then proceeded to do mock CPR and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, just to be on the safe side.
Bjorkman probably won't be winning any Oscars for his acting ability, but at least he may have earned himself some new fans.
Meanwhile, theatrics aside, Neymar himself remains subject to much speculation about his club future.
He continues to be linked as a possible replacement for Cristiano Ronaldo at Real Madrid, following the latter's departure to Juventus.
However, Madrid have denied they will be making any approach for the Paris Saint-Germain star.
