Arsenal and Liverpool target Edinson Cavani has quashed talk that he wants to leave Paris Saint-Germain this summer.
The Uruguay striker is set to be the French club’s main striker next season following the departure of talisman Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
However, Arsenal and Liverpool have apparently both registered an interest in the 29-year-old and he was also on Juventus’ wishlist before they signed Gonzalo Higuain.
But Cavani insists he has no plans to leave Paris now he has been installed as the club’s primary frontman.
“Yes, I want to stay here,” he told L’Equipe.
“When the club signed me, they introduced me to a project, and I really wanted to be a part of it.
“I have two years left on my contract, and it is up to PSG whether they want to extend it or not.”
