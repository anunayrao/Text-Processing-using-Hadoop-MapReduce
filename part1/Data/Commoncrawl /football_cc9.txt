Arsenal Wenger is to blame for Arsenal’s failure to end their 13-year injury jinx, according to Dutch fitness coach Raymond Verheijen.
Per Mertesacker is the latest Gunners star to be sidelined, with a knee problem set to keep the German defender out for around four months.
It comes as a big blow to the Frenchman, who will be forced to dip into the transfer market for a defender as he attempts to keep them on track for a Premier League title challenge.
But Verheijen told talkSPORT Wenger must take responsibility for the structural problems which don’t help their dreadful injury record.
He told the Alan Brazil Sports Breakfast: “Last year there was a big investigation and all the stats were checked and for the last 13 seasons Arsenal have an injury, on average, once every five games and that’s unprecedented.
“It’s probably the worst injury record in the whole of Europe. So, one way or another, there is a structural problem within Arsenal, in terms of injuries.
“As we know, the main reason for injuries is fatigue because if you accumulate fatigue from week-to-week then your control of your body decreases, so you have less co-ordination with explosive actions.
“That is probably what is going wrong inside Arsenal and it is a responsibility of Arsene Wenger to sort this problem, but he hasn’t fixed it for 13 years.”
