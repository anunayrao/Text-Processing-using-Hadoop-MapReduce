NEWPORT, R.I. (AP) -- Li Na has received the most support in the first fan vote for the International Tennis Hall of Fame, followed by Goran Ivanisevic and Mary Pierce.
Results of the six-week online balloting for fans were announced Tuesday. The Hall did not say how many people participated.
Li will get a 3 percent boost to her total for the overall vote by the main selection panel, which includes members of the Hall, journalists and tennis historians. Ivanisevic gets 2 percent, and Pierce 1 percent.
Li, a two-time major champion from China, could become the first player from Asia elected to the Hall.
The Class of 2019 will be announced in January. There are five other candidates: Jonas Bjorkman, Sergi Bruguera, Yevgeny Kafelnikov, Conchita Martinez and Thomas Muster.
