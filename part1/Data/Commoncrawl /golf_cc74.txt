As a general rule, players and their caddies must walk the course at USGA championships and at most qualifying rounds. Consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), a disabled player or caddie may be permitted to use a golf cart as an accommodation to his or her disability for those events where golf carts are not allowed. As required by the ADA, the USGA will evaluate such requests on a case-by-case basis.
In order for the USGA to properly evaluate the merits of such requests, while maintaining the fundamental fairness of the golf competition, it is necessary for players requesting this accommodation to submit medical documentation to facilitate that analysis. The documentation provided must demonstrate: (1) a player’s or caddie’s disability as defined by the ADA (temporary conditions may not be covered); (2) the medical need for the golf cart that results from that disability; and (3) that by providing a golf cart to a player or caddie in that particular circumstances, the USGA would not be fundamentally altering the fairness of the competition by providing a player with an advantage over other players. The required form entitled Golf Cart Request Form (as well as additional important information for first-time and subsequent requests for a cart), is available through the USGA website in the section identified as Championships/Apply to Play/Additional Entry Policies, Procedures & Information.
In order to permit the USGA to undertake the necessary analysis and make arrangements for golf cart usage where approved, all in time for the relevant event, players must strictly comply with each of the following procedures. Any failure to comply with any of these procedures may result in a denial of the requested accommodation.
