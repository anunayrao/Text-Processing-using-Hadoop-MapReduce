On Thursday, Serena Williams visited The Late Show with David Letterman to talk tennis, life and just about everything else.
The U.S. Open kicks off next week, and Serena is the favorite to snag her second Grand Slam of the season and 17th of her career, but this week is a time for fun and she sure had it on Letterman.
Letterman brought up Billie Jean King versus Bobby Riggs and asked Serena about her chances against Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
This idea had been brought up before, but Serena set the record straight with who would actually win if the two had a Battle of the Sexes II.
Williams answered, "Men's tennis and women's tennis are almost two separate sports. If I was to play Andy Murray I would lose 6-0, 6-0 in five to six minutes, maybe 10 minutes."
Now, I'm not so sure it would be that quick, but I definitely think if it happened the viewership would be out of this world. She can discount herself all she wants against someone like Andy Murray, but if there is a woman in this world I would like to see try to take down the best male tennis player, it is Serena Williams.
