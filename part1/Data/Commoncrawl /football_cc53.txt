Blackpool winger Tom Ince looks set to shun a move to the Premier League in favour of joining French giants Monaco, according to The Daily Mail sports editor Les Snowdon.
The England under-21 international has long been tipped for a move away from Bloomfield Road and both Tottenham and Swansea are known admirers.
However, it is understood Ince and his father and Blackpool manager, Paul, held talks with the Ligue 1 side today about the 21-year-old joining the club once his contract expires this summer.
Snowdon told Kick Off: “He is in serious talks with Monaco. His father apparently body swerved a press conference and him and Tom were in London today talking with Monaco representatives.
“Ajax and Inter Milan are also after him and I think Swansea and Tottenham would take hin but it looks as if he could be heading to Monaco.”
