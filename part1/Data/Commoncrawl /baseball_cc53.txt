Hi! My name is Eddy Tapia and I'm the new Baseball Assistance Team Intern. I graduated from Ithaca College in May 2016 with a degree in Sport Studies. I was fortunate enough to work in a variety of sports-related internships and jobs with companies like Point3 Basketball and the Ithaca College Office of Recreational Sports during my time at Ithaca.
However, the most rewarding experience I had while attending college was studying abroad in Siena, Italy and traveling through Europe. Full immersion in a wide range of cultures and customs challenged my understanding of the way people around the world live their lives. The time I spent abroad helped shape both my personal and professional goals.
Looking ahead, I am excited for the opportunity to be a part of the wonderful work that B.A.T. is doing. Helping improve the quality of life of those in need is something that I sincerely value and the Baseball Assistance Team is the perfect way to pursue that passion. Let's get started!
