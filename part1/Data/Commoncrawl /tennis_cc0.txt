Just two months on from his infamous comments about counting his millions, Bernard Tomic has again bragged about his riches.
The wayward tennis star made the comments in an interview following revelations his mate allegedly spiked a woman's drink at a nightclub on the Gold Coast.
When asked about the nightclub incident, Tomic - who hasn't stepped foot on a tennis court since early January - referenced his brief stint on reality TV show I'm a Celebrity…Get Me Out of here, and bragged about the size of his bank account.
"I just made a million dollars for four days on I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here," he told The Gold Coast Bulletin.

"I just bought another house. I'm buying everything on the Gold Coast." 
In January, after being knocked out of Australian Open qualifying, Tomic told reporters "I just count money, that's all I do. I just count my millions."
He copped a global backlash for the comments before entering the I'm a Celebrity… jungle, where he only lasted four days.
The latest controversy comes with Tomic's rankings in freefall and his tennis career in a state of limbo.

He has been knocked out in the first round in four of the last six ATP Tournaments he's played. He has also failed to make it past the third round in five of the last six Grand Slams he has appeared in.
News of the nightclub drink spiking comes after the woman's parents revealed the incident on social media.
Staff at the nightclub are assisted police with their investigations, but CCTV didn't show any wrongdoing.
"We're aware of the alleged incident and are very concerned by the seriousness of it," spokesman Matt Keegan told the Courier Mail.
"Since Sunday, staff have thoroughly reviewed the CCTV footage which tracks the patron (Ms McCarthy) throughout the night."
