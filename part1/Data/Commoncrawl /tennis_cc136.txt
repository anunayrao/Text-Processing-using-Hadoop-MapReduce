It appeared that Maria Sharapova didn't get the memo of when her quarterfinal match started, getting smoked 6-0 in the first set by Jelena Jankovic.
The defending champion had 20 unforced errors in that first set, but got it together after that, winning the second and third sets 6-3, 6-4 to advance to her third straight French Open semifinal.
Rafael Nadal cruised in his match against Stanislas Wawrinka 6-2, 6-3, 6-1, setting up a can't miss semifinal against Novak Djokovic, who also won his quarterfinal match in straight sets against Tommy Haas.
Tennis is a game of sportsmanship and for some reason I thought this was a great shot of Tommy Haas and Novak Djokovic embracing after their quarterfinal match.
I continue to love what Uniqlo is doing with Novak on the tennis court. This shirt is simple, but the color just works, especially against the red of the clay courts.
Apparently not the same can be said for what he wears off the court. This puffy vest is, well, something I guess.
Thursday at the French Open will give us the semifinals for the women's draw. Serena Williams will square off against Sara Errani as Maria Sharapova takes on Victoria Azarenka.
