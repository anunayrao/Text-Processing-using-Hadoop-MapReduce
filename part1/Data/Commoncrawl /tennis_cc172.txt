There are plenty of terms you could use to describe Novak Djokovic. In a former life we knew him as a guy that couldn't always get it done, but the guy is a stud now and is looking to become the only player in the Open era to win the Australian Open three times in a row.
And now, maybe we can call him The Hulk? Novak ripped off his own shirt after beating Stanislas Wawrinka 1-6, 7-5, 6-4, 6-7 (5), 12-10 in an epic five-set match on Sunday in Rod Laver Arena.
The result of the ripping? Novak, ripped up, with photo and video below.
