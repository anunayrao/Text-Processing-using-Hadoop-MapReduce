Tennis fans are asking whether Tomic the Tank Engine is up to his old tricks again after Bernard Tomic put in a bizarre performance in being bundled out of an ATP Tour event in Florida.

Tomic won the first set against Belgian Steve Darcis, but ended up on the wrong side of a 3-6 6-1 6-4 scoreline. 

Worse still? He was up 4-1 in the third before Darcis stormed home to send Tomic packing. 
But the score only tells half the story. 
Footage of the end of the match shows Tomic apparently giving up, allowing the world number 57 through to the second round.

Tomic has a long history of appearing to give up midway through matches. 
Most recently, he copped global criticism for his weak display at the French Open, where he lost in the second round to Borna Coric.
That came just weeks after he held his racquet backwards in a loss to Fabio Fognini at the Madrid Open.
