When Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez combined to score a world class penalty against Celta Vigo in February, it was lauded as a moment of genius from two of the world’s best players.
A copy of Johan Cruyff’s famous spot kick, it involved Messi tricking the keeper into a dive, but laying off the ball to Suarez rather than shooting. Then, it was just a simple finish for the Uruguayan striker.
That kind of goal was always going to have imitators, but the last attempt came from Peruvian side Alianza Atletico – who royally screwed it up.
Whilst the dummy and lay-off are perfect, with the keeper diving without the ball being kicked, the player who follows up can only shoot the ball against the inside of the post, watching on in horror as it flies away from goal!
Is it the worst penalty ever? You can watch it above and decide for yourself…
