Tennis legend Andre Agassi is adamant only a coach can get the best out of Australian Nick Kyrgios, who powered into the fourth round of the Australian Open on Friday night.

Kyrgios showed plenty of maturity and composure to see off Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in a tight four-set battle, with the 22-year-old now set to play third seed Grigor Dimitrov for a spot in the quarters.

Currently coaching Novak Djokovic, Agassi has advised Kyrgios to find a coach sooner rather than later to ensure his game reaches the next level but concedes he must find the right person for the job.
"To go it alone and not get access to things tried and lessons learned is an unforced error," Agassi told The Sydney Morning Herald.
"I would imagine that there would be a lot of people that would take a great deal of pride in coaching him (Kyrgios) just based on his talent alone.
"If I was him, I would sit down in a room somewhere and put some deep thought into whom might bring to the table something that I may feel I need that I don't have.
"I always surround myself by knowing my weaknesses and filling those gaps. You do it business, you do it in life, and doing it on the tennis court, I would highly suggest that to anybody."
Agassi, who has eight grand slams to his name, had a number of coaches during his turbulent career including Nick Bollettieri, Brad Gilbert and Australian Darren Cahill.
Playing without an official coach at the moment, Kyrgios has previously worked with Simon Rea, Joshua Eagle, Todd Larkham and SÃ©bastien Grosjean.
