Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis has slammed Gonzalo Higuain for betraying the club and joining Juventus.
The striker completed a £75.3m move to the Italian champions on Tuesday after they activated his release-clause.
Before the switch, Arsenal had been in the hunt but they could not compete with Juventus’ spending power as they sealed a deal which makes Higuain the third most expensive player in history.
The Argentina international’s move means Napoli have been severely weakened in their attempts to catch Juve, who finished ahead of them to win Serie A last season.
And president De Laurentiis has revealed his fury at Higuain’s decision to jump ship to one of Napoli’s biggest rivals.
“We understood, ever since the first statements released by Higuain’s brother [and agent], that we risked having to look for a new striker,” De Laurentiis told Corriere dello Sport.
“But we didn’t seriously expect him to leave, nor that he’d erase his three years in Naples in this manner.
“Some believe that talking of a betrayal is an exaggeration, but I think differently. In this move there is the full meaning of a betrayal, which includes ingratitude.”
