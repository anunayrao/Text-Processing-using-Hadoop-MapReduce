To determine the total pay packages of Football Bowl Subdivision (formerly known as Division I-A) coaches for their current contract years, USA TODAY requested all forms of compensation for the head football coach at all 120 schools. USA TODAY obtained at least some information on all but nine schools, most of which are private. Four public schools did not provide contracts; 17 did not provide the NCAA-mandated outside income report, which covers athletically related income the coach receives from non-university sources (e.g. support organization, apparel contracts). Schools that provided contract information were given the opportunity to review their figures. A not available (NA) in the chart denotes schools that are private or did not release the information or schools whose coaches are new and had not filed an outside income report. A $0 means either the coach doesn't get compensation from that activity/source or it's contained in another category and the documentation did not break it down.
Explanations of compensation catgories
Salary: Base salary, deferred payments earned on an annual basis, annuity payments for current contract year, payments based on ticket revenue when available, contractual expense accounts, housing allowances, etc. Salaries reported do not take into account deductions that have, or may, occur because of state government furlough actions.
Other income: Income for most recently available year from contract provisions other than those related to salary or from other agreements (e.g. shoe and/or apparel contracts; consideration for appearing on TV, radio or other media shows; making speeches or other public appearances; camps). Universities generally guarantee most — but not all — of this income; some might come from outside sources.
Total salary: Combination of salary and other income. Value of perks such as game tickets, luxury suites, cars, family travel, country club memberships and standard university benefits such as health care are not included.
Maximum bonus: The greatest amount that can be received if team meets prescribed on-field performance goals (e.g., win totals, bowl game appearances, conference and/or national championships, coach of the year awards, etc.), academic and/or player-conduct goals.
Footnotes
•Connecticut: Edsall receives additional compensation under a shoe-apparel contract and from his annual camp. The university declined to release information about either.
•Florida: Contract not yet released. Salary based on school-announced average of $4 million a year. The university declined to release outside income information.
•Michigan State: Maximum bonus represents the amount of the pool for Dantonio and his assistant coaches from which Dantonio is guaranteed $175,000, plus a share determined at the discretion of him and the athletics director.
•North Carolina: Davis receives additional compensation under media and shoe-apparel contracts the university declined to release. The deals paid him $499,000 in 2007 and were scheduled to pay $505,000 in 2008, the university said in 2007. The university declined to release the amount this year.
•Oregon: Includes supplemental payment based on ticket sales and team television appearances that is guaranteed at $250,000 but could be higher.
•Purdue: Hope is guaranteed this amount for the 2009 season because his bonus earnings, when added to a base salary of $220,000, will not exceed the guaranteed amount. In the future, if his base salary and bonuses exceed the guaranteed amount, he will receive only the base salary and the bonuses.
•Temple: Information is from a report for fiscal 2008 required by Pennsylvania's Right-to-Know Law.
•Texas Christian: Current-year compensation total; information provided by the athletics department.
•Texas Tech: Salary includes an $800,000 bonus that will be due if Leach remains the school's head coach as of Dec. 31.
