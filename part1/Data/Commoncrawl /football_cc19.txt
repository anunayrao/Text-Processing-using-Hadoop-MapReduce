Javier Mascherano has agreed a new three-year contract at Barcelona to end speculation about his future.
The Argentina international has been linked with a move away from the Nou Camp this summer, with strong rumours of a transfer to Juventus, but he has now committed his future to the Catalan club.
Sporting director Albert Soler said: “An agreement has been reached and Mascherano will continue at Barcelona for the next three years.”
The 32-year-old, who joined from Liverpool in 2010, has made over 250 appearances for the club, winning 16 trophies.
News of Mascherano’s new deal comes on the same day that Valencia midfielder Andre Gomes completed his move to club after passing a medical and putting pen to paper.
The Portugal international arrived at the Nou Camp on Tuesday night following an announcement last Thursday that a reported £29.2million deal had been agreed between the two La Liga clubs.
He completed the formalities by officially signing his contract on Wednesday morning.
Gomes said at his unveiling press conference: “I have chosen the best club for me. It is an honour and a privilege to wear this shirt.
“I am 22 and I want to grow. I have come to learn. Here, I have many references.
“Barca relates to my way of playing football and to my identity. I hope to enjoy and win many titles.”
