Sunderland flop Ji Dong-Won has moved to Bundesliga side Augsburg for an undisclosed fee.
The 22-year-old South Korean has failed to impress at the Stadium of Light since arriving from Chunnam Dragons of the K-League in summer 2011.
He has managed just 28 appearances and two goals, although one of those was a memorable winner against Manchester City on New Yearâ€™s Day in 2012.
Ji had a loan spell with Augsburg last season, making 17 appearances and scoring five goals.
