The Toronto Blue Jays Baseball Academy will be hosting Instructional Clinics powered by Honda throughout Ontario for beginner baseball players aged 8 to 12. These one day, four-hour clinics take place on weekends in May and June.
Instructional Clinics powered by Honda are taught exclusively by Blue Jays Baseball Academy Instructors. Academy Instructors are NCCP registered, experienced coaches, who have been trained in the "Blue Jays Way" of teaching baseball to youth. Many instructors have been with the Blue Jays Baseball Academy for several years, facilitating clinics and camps when they aren't teaching baseball in their own communities. 
Participants will receive a Blue Jays hat, T-shirt and baseball manual with information to take home and continue to develop their baseball skills.
Instructional Clinics powered by Honda also serve as a fundraising opportunity for the host baseball association or little league, as $25 from each registration is donated back to the host organization after the first 25 registrations. In 2018, the Blue Jays were able to donate more than $25,000 back to amateur baseball in Ontario as a result.
New for 2019: As in years past, Instructional Clinics powered by Honda, feature infield, outfield, and hitting stations. New for 2019, Instructional Clinic registrants will participate in a Baseball Athletic Training station which serves as an introduction to fundamental athletic movement, and a Game Station where participants will play a whiffle ball baseball game. This new format has been developed in partnership with Baseball Canada and current best practices and we're excited to begin its launch at our 23 Instructional Clinic locations.
While Instructional Clinics powered by Honda are inclusive for everyone, we will host an Instructional Clinic powered by Honda at Connorvale Park in Toronto, specifically for female baseball players. Instruction will be in collaboration with Blue Jays Academy Instructors and coaches from and Royal York Girls Baseball, respectively. See below for a video from our 2018 girls clinic.
On June 10, 2018, the Blue Jays Baseball Academy hosted an Instructional Clinic powered by Honda in Brampton for 120 youth baseball players ages 8-14.

All registered participants will receive a confirmation email after registering for the clinic. An information email about the clinic will be sent out roughly five days prior to the clinic date and will contain details about the clinic including when to arrive, what to bring and if necessary, details on the inclement weather plan. Receipts will be emailed to participants at least two business days after registering.     
All participants are asked to bring a baseball glove, bat, helmet, baseball cleats or running shoes, and be dressed in appropriate athletic attire. Please also bring enough water, snacks, and sunscreen based on the weather that day. We ask participants arrive at least 30 minutes prior to the start of the clinic to check in. All clinics run for four hours with one 15 minute break and two shorter breaks. Parents are encouraged to stay and watch, and there are opportunities to volunteer on-field should they choose.
At Instructional Clinics powered by Honda, host association coaches and in some cases, parents of registrants have the opportunity to volunteer at the clinic. The purpose of this is to learn tips and techniques which they can take back to their teams. Knowledge of baseball or coaching is not necessary. National Coaches Certification Program (NCCP) registered coaches who sign up to volunteer online will have the opportunity to receive one professional development point towards certification.
Once the clinic begins, the Blue Jays Baseball Academy Lead Instructor will organize the volunteer coaches and assign roles. Please make sure to wear running shoes and athletic wear. Upon registration online, we will confirm your attendance the week of the clinic.
A full refund, less a $10 administration fee, will be granted if registration is cancelled at least 48 hours prior to clinic date. Any cancellations within 48 hours of the clinic will not receive a refund. 
For any questions about the Instructional Clinic powered by Honda in your area, please contact the Blue Jays Baseball Academy at 416-341-2500 or email at baseball.academy@bluejays.com. Please note that as we travel for clinics, response time on weekends and holidays may not be immediate.
