The 2019 National Coaches Clinic powered by Honda took place January 25th to 27th at Rogers Centre and featured three days of presentations and on field sessions with the goal of providing coaches with tips and techniques to bring back to their local teams. 
Speakers for the clinic included: Mark Shapiro, Cito Gaston, Jack Morris, John Schneider, Jeff Ware, and others. Presentations were divided into two new formats where coaches rotated through six stations allowing for smaller, more intimate talks, complemented with keynote speakers each day. 
 In addition to the speakers and on field portions on Saturday and Sunday, coaches in attendance had the opportunity to attend a four hour National Coaching Certification Program (NCCP) module on Friday, January 25th.
