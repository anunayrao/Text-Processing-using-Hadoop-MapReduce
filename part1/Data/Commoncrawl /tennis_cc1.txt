She withdrew from the Australian Open in January after she said she wasn't where she wanted to be physically, but made her return at the U.S. Fed Cup match on Feb. 11.

With some question as to which events and how many Williams would participate in this year, her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, revealed her plans to play in many of the major tournaments, including all three remaining grand slams. He added that the load would be lighter than normal.
"She can't do seasons like 2013 or 2014," said Mouratoglou in an interview with The New York Times . 
"In 2013, she won 11 tournaments. That was herculean. She doesn't have the same age, and I'm not sure she even wants that anymore. The focus for her will be on the big moments."
Williams will compete at Indian Wells, Miami, Madrid, Rome, the French Open, Wimbledon, one hard court event still to be decided in August, the U.S. Open and the WTA Finals in Singapore if she makes it into the top eight.
Mouratoglou also added that both he and Williams were confident in her return to tennis.
"She's coming back because she believes she can win, otherwise, she wouldn't be coming back."
Here's the list of the tournaments Williams is set to play at in 2018:
