Bartolo Colon put on a fabulous display atop the mound in the Rangers' 3-1 win over the Astros on Sunday night. He cruised into seven perfect innings, but that perfection ceased to be after a lead-off walk by Carlos Correa and a Josh Reddick double.Â 
Despite the somewhat unhappy ending, the baseball world and adoring fans were filled to the brim with excitement with what they were witnessing.
As the innings flew by, we weren't sure how Colon was handling the pressure. Well:

He even got respect from former players who faced him:
That was fun.Faced Bart in '02 on cold CLE night and he basically sat 100 all game. Throws one 99 in top 8 and somebody at end of bench says, "Time to get him, boys. He's slowing down." It's a trip to see this version of him.
And those who were Dan Haren:
I threw 88 with 1000% effort.
And when it was over, there was nothing but respect from Bartolo:
Very cool by Bartolo Colon: Gives a wave on his way off the mound to Josh Reddick, who broke up the no-hitter.

With some fun facts:
Colon, at 44 years, 326 days, is oldest pitcher to ever carry a no-hitter to 8th inning. No pitcher at this age has gone more than 7 innings and allowed 1 hit.
And yes, it was a perfect game in its own way:
If you really think about it, every game Bartolo pitches in is a perfect game
Bartolo didn't lose his perfect game; the perfect game lost Bartolo.
And they don't call him Big Sexy for nothing:
