Borussia Dortmund striker Robert Lewandowksi will join Bayern Munich in the summer on a free transfer.
The striker was one of the most sought-after attackers in Europe and was coveted by Manchester United and Chelsea, but Bayern Munich have announced on their official website that he will sign a five-year contract after undergoing a medical.
Just like Mario Gotze, who left Dortmund for the Champions League holders last summer after confirming during the 2012/13 season that he would leave for Munich, Lewandowski has sealed his switch mid-campaign by signing a pre-contract with the Bavarian giants.
Angered by Gotze’s departure, Dortmund blocked Bayern’s move for the prolific Polish forward last summer, despite knowing that he could leave for free when his contract expired in 2014.
Chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge was delighted with the deal and said on Bayern’s official website: “We are very pleased that this transfer is successful. Robert Lewandowski is one of the world’s best strikers, he will strengthen the squad of FC Bayern and give us a boost.
“We are very pleased that today, from both sides, a five-year contract was signed until 2019.”
Lewandowski has scored 15 goals for Dortmund so far this season, including a Champions League winner at Arsenal to help them reach the last 16, but the champions from 2011 and 2012 trail leaders Bayern by 12 points in the Bundesliga.
Now they will have to prepare for life without their main goal scorer.
