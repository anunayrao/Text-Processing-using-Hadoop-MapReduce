Marseille are growing increasingly frustrated with Tottenham, who are still not allowing Clinton N’Jie to leave London to negotiate a loan move to the French club.
The Cameroon striker did not travel with Spurs to their pre-season tour of Australia amid speculation that his time in north London is coming to an end.
Reports earlier this week suggested N’Jie was due in the south of France to complete a medical on Wednesday but, according to L’Equipe, he is still in London and is training with the club’s academy teams.
Despite the delay, both parties are confident of getting a loan deal over the line with a view to making it permanent next summer.
