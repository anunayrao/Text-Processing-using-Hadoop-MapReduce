Galatasaray are happy to wait until Everton drop their asking price for out-of-favour forward Oumar Niasse.
Everton only signed Niasse from Lokomotiv Moscow in January but the Senegalese made just seven appearances for the Merseysiders and failed to register a goal.
New Everton manager Ronald Koeman has decided Niasse has no future at Goodison Park and has sanctioned his departure, although a loan deal appears to be the most likely outcome at this stage.
Everton are holding out for Galatasaray to pay them £1m plus the entirety of Niasse’s wages for a one-year spell.
But the Turkish giants are biding their time on the deal and could wait until the end of the transfer window to make their move, with Everton likely to have lowered their demands by then.
