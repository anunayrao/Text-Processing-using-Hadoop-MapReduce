News Corp is a network of leading companies in the worlds of diversified media, news, education, and information services.

This Wednesday morning on Sportsday we discuss how seven Russian swimmers and three rowers have been banned from competing at the Rio Olympic Games by their sports’ governing bodies.
We also look at Gonzalo Higuaín’s move from Napoli to Juventus and how this could affect Paul Pogba’s transfer from Juve to Manchester United and we preview Celtic’s Champions League third qualifying round tie with FC Astana this afternoon.
All brought to you by Russ Hargreaves and the team.
