The world number 43 is heading to New Haven next week to see if she is fit enough to play in the Connecticut Open prior to the US Open beginning in early September.

Stosur has been using lighter balls to allow her hand to adjust to the pressure of playing again, but has recently graduated to "real balls".
Stosur won the US Open back in 2011, and whilst she has been paying attention to other WTA results, her main focus has been ramping up her rehab.
