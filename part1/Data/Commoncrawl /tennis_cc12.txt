With a record 11,000 career aces to his name, Croatian tennis player Ivo Karlovic is the man nobody wants to train with.

On tour it's customary for players to have a hit with others but Karlovic's powerful 211cm frame means he's more often than not left to play with his coach.

"It's not that often that I get to practice with another player," Karlovic told the ATP website.
"They aren't used to my game and they can't find a rhythm."
"They don't really like to practice with me, but I don't have a problem with that. I have to see my coach almost every day on the other side of the net."
The 37-year-old who is currently ranked 18th in the world certainly can see the bright side of his lack of playing partners.
"The less they practice with me, the less likely they are to get used to my game."
