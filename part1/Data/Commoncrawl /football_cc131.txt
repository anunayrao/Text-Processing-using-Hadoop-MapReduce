Thunder Collins, 23, of Lincoln, Neb., has been charged with first-degree burglary and second-degree assault. Police said Collins is in the Benton County Jail on $75,000 bail. 
Police responded after midnight Tuesday to reports of a disturbance at the Corvallis apartment of Oregon State sophomore Jamaal Jackson, said Lt. Ron Noble, a spokesman for the Corvallis Police Department. 
Jackson, a 20-year-old business major, shares the apartment with his girlfriend, Shannon Howell, a sociology major. Howell is a former girlfriend of Collins. 
According to police, Collins entered the dwelling while the two were sleeping and attacked Jackson. The couple fled, as did Collins. 
Collins was later found nearby, trying to find a taxi, Noble said. 
Jackson sustained a possible broken jaw, Noble said. He was taken to Good Samaritan Hospital in Corvallis, but has since checked out. Howell was not injured. 
Howell had recently spoken on the telephone with Collins, Noble said. He said that's when the former Cornhusker boarded a plane to Portland International Airport and took a 90-mile taxi ride to Corvallis. 
"A very determined young man," Noble said. 
Collins, a reserve tailback, quit the Cornhuskers in October 2002, after he was suspended for four games for violating undisclosed NCAA rules. 
In June 2001, he was charged with misdemeanor assault after fighting with then-girlfriend Howell. Collins pleaded guilty to a lesser charge. 
At that time, Collins told a judge the two were still dating and had had no altercations since his ticketing.
