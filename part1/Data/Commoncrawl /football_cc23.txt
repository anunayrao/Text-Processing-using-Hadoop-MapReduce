Arsenal fans are fearing the worst ahead of the new Premier League season. 
Centre-back Per Mertesacker was recently ruled out of action for ‘a few months’, according to manager Arsene Wenger, and he is running out of defensive options, with Calum Chambers and Rob Holding set to pair in their pre-season tour.
Wenger has only brought in three players so far this summer – Granit Xhaka (costing in the region of £30m), youngster Holding from Bolton and Japanese forward Takuma Asano – and fans want to see more through the doors at the Emirates. In comparison to rivals chasing the top four, including Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City, Jose Mourinho’s Manchester United and Antonio Conte’s Chelsea, that is very little.
