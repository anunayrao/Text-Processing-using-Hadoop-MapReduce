Sunderland have granted the Football Association permission to speak with Sam Allardyce about the England job.
The 61-year-old boss is a contender to replace Roy Hodgson and, after reports suggested the former West Ham and Bolton boss had met FA vice-chairman David Gill for talks, the Premier League club moved to confirm ‘what was supposed to be a confidential discussion’. 
Allardyce only took over at the Stadium of Light last October, replacing Dick Advocaat as he helped the Black Cats steer clear of relegation from the top tier. 
Sunderland made their frustrations clear in the statement, as it disrupts their plans ahead of the new Premier League season. 
While Allardyce provded to be popular with fans on Wearside, they are, like the club, keen to see a resolution to Allardyce’s future – see some fans’ reaction on social media, below:
