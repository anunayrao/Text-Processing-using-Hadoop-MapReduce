The issue for some Penn State fans, as they have related in letters and e-mails, is that Bowden earned 31 of his 359 victories at Samford from 1959 to 1962. Samford, then known as Howard College, did not play major college football at the time. It is now in Division I-AA.
Paterno, in his 40th season at Penn State, has all of his 353 victories with the Nittany Lions. So shouldn't Paterno be ahead of Bowden on the I-A victories list? Not according to how the NCAA computes its records. 
Jim Wright, NCAA director of statistics, says a coach needs at least a five-year career to make an NCAA "active" victories list and 10 years to make an all-time list.
"Once he hits that, all previous games he coached are counted, provided they came against four-year schools," Wright says.
As Wright points out, the criteria are not specific to the Bowden-Paterno issue, nor to just football.
"It's a long-term policy," Wright says. "I've been (with the NCAA) for 30 years, and it was in place before I started. ... What we're trying to represent here is a coach's career. Once you've surpassed the minimums, we don't presume to go in and edit specific games.
"When we get e-mails about it, the point I make is there's a constant changing with teams moving from one division to another, like the Ivy League, which used to be prominent then switched and is now I-AA. With the wild fluctuation from I-A to I-AA and other teams, like Florida Atlantic and Florida International, going the other way, it would be very hard to draw some distinction."
The issue is not, officially at least, one of contention at Penn State. "The NCAA has indicated those wins count in Coach Bowden's record, so it's nothing we've ever pursued," says spokesman Jeff Nelson.
Paterno said last week that it doesn't matter. Bowden said he has heard complaints but points out there were no divisions then.
Wright anticipates more discussion as the FedEx Orange Bowl nears.
"We're prepared for a flood of e-mails," he says.
