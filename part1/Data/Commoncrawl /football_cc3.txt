Paul Pogba’s move back to Manchester United is only now reportedly being held up by his agent’s fee for securing the transfer.
Mino Raiola, who also represents new Red Devils Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Henrikh Mkhitaryan, is due £25m should the £100m transfer go through, although the hold up is over who will pay it.
While Raiola believes Juventus should pay it as he is bringing them in a world record transfer fee, Juve are refusing to pay him a penny.
Manchester United are thought to be willing to compromise and pay half of the £25m, with Juventus paying the other half, but the Italian champions are unwilling to budge.
Even if United manage to pay £12.5m, that is still just £0.25m short of the fee they paid for Cristiano Ronaldo, but who could they get for the full £25m, should they end up paying it?
