Swansea City and Newcastle will face a fight with Turkish side Besiktas for the signing of Lyon striker Bafetimbi Gomis.
The French forward has long been linked with a move to the English top flight, although a mooted move to Newcastle fell through last summer.
The 28-year-old is out of contract at the end of the season and will not be extending his stay at the club he joined in 2009 from Saint-Etienne.
Now Turkish side Besiktas are aware of the Senegal-born star’s situation and are planning to offer him a deal, according to Mercato365.
Cardiff City rivalled their Welsh neighbours for Gomis’ signature in the summer but their interest will have gone along with former manager Malky Mackay.
Gomis has scored seven goals in 15 Ligue 1 appearances so far this season, as well as two in the Champions League.
