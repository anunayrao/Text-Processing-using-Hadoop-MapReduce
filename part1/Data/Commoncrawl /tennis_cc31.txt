"Why the f*** did I play doubles?"

Nick Kyrgios was dirty at himself for playing a three-set doubles fixture in sweltering conditions in Melbourne on Thursday just a day before his third round match-up against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.

Temperatures soared to 69 degrees on Rod Laver Arena in Novak Djokovic's clash with Gael Monfils, while the outside courts experienced their own issues with Melbourne hitting 42 degrees at some points.
With the sun sapping most of his energy a day before, Kyrgios was beginning to feel the burn as Tsonga claimed a second set lead 2-3 after he took the first set 7-6.
Channel Seven tennis commentator Jim Courier said the Australian needs to rethink his approach and have a more conservative mindset if he is any chance of doing damage at a home grand slam.
"If Nick thinks he has a serious chance to win a major, he does need to stop playing doubles," Courier said.
"It is a mistake to play, even if you enjoy it with your friends, because you can have some bad luck, get stuck in a 40 degree day like he did yesterday.
"They are not a threat to win the doubles tournament, it is not like they are going to win the doubles - that is not going to happen.
"All the players who think they have a serious chance to win majors in singles skip the doubles. They just do it because you can get caught out best of five and then you are backing that up.''
Despite giving up the second set, the 22-year-old fought back to regain his lead in a third set tie-break.
Kyrgios and Matt Reid will take on Jeremy Martin and Fabrice Martin on Saturday, a day before a possible fourth round match against world no.3 Grigor Dimitrov.
