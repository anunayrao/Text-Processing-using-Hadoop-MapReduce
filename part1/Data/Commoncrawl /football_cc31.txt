Roma are set to renew their interest in Everton defender John Heitinga.
The Dutch defender seems certain to leave the Merseyside club and has already turned down a move to West Ham in the January transfer window.
Heitinga has struggled to command a first-team place at Goodison Park under Roberto Martinez.
The 30-year-old has made only one appearance as a substitute in the Premier League this season and is keen to get his career back on track
Stoke City have also been linked with a move for the experienced defender, but reports in Italy claim Roma are now stepping up their move to sign him as Argentina international Nicolas Burdisso has handed in a transfer request.
Heitingaâ€™s contract at Everton is due to run out at the end of the season and they will not want to risk him walking away as a free agent.
