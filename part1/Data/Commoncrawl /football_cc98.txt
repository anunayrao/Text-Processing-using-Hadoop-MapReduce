Hamburg are lining up a summer swoop for Juventus new boy Mario Lemina, who is a target for both Arsenal and Leicester.
The Gabon international spent last season on loan in Turin and Juve decided to make the move permanent in a deal worth £8million in April.
However, he could be on the move almost straight away, and both Arsenal and Leicester are keeping tabs on the situation.
Reports in Italy have also linked both Stoke and Watford to Lemina this summer but now it is Hamburg who have emerged as favourites to land him.
According to L’Equipe, Juventus will listen to offers for the former Marseille and Lorient man but they hope to receive around £20million for him to ensure a quick and healthy profit.
