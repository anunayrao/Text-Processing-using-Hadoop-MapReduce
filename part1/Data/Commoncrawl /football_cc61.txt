Norwich boss Chris Hughton is wary of doing duff deals in the January window as he looks to guide the club to safety.
Jonas Gutierrez joined the Canaries from Newcastle United last week and Hughton admits he would like to add more players to his injury-hit squad.
However, Hughton has seen rushed and last-ditch deals synonymous with the winter window go bad and he does not want to err with the club in a perilous position.
“We’re trying,” he said. “You can see that there’s not been a lot of work done in the market, as of yet.
“Jonas will be a good addition as he knows the league very well, having played almost 200 games in this division, so he’ll be a bonus for us.
“We are trying as hard as we can, the same as everybody else, but January is a notoriously bad time to bring in players.”
