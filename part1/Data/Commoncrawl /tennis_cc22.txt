Doohan died just months after being diagnosed with an aggressive form of motor neurone disease.

The Australian was given the nickname the 'Becker Wrecker' after defeating two-time defending champion, Boris Becker, at SW19 in 1987.
In a statement released on Saturday, Tennis Australia passed on its condolences to those close to Doohan.
"Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends," the statement read.
"Peter was unbeaten in Davis Cup representation. He won the South Australian Open singles title and reached No. 15 in doubles, winning five titles during his distinguished career.
"Following his retirement, Peter coached in the United States, after first studying at the University of Arkansas, where he was an all-American and a NCAA champion. He returned to live in Australia in 2009.
"The tennis community rallied around Peter during his battle with a particularly aggressive form of motor neurone disease which was diagnosed just nine weeks ago."
