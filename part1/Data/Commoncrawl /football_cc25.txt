Middlesbrough boss Aitor Karanka has made use of his friendship with Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho by snapping up the highly rated Nathaniel Chalobah on loan.
The Spanish boss was Mourinhoâ€™s assistant at Real Madrid last year and has used his connection to bring in the England under-21 international until the end of the season.
The 19-year-old defender spent the first half of the season at Nottingham Forest and made 12 appearances.
