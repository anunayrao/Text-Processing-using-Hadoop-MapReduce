The Angels Baseball Foundation, established in 2004, concentrates on investments in education, healthcare, arts and sciences, and community-related youth programs throughout the region. In addition, the Foundation provides children the opportunity to experience the great game of baseball and its countless positive attributes. The Angels Baseball Foundation has distributed grants to hundreds of various programs throughout Southern California. Every year, thousands of memorabilia items such as baseballs, uniforms, and tickets are donated to local charities to assist with their fundraising efforts.
