(Jan. 11) – The United States Golf Association has announced the launch of the official application for the 2010-2011 editions of “The Rules of Golf,” “Decisions on The Rules of Golf” and “Rules of Amateur Status” for the iPhone and iPod touch.The Rules of Golf App is designed for golfers who want instant access to the official Rules and Decisions. With this application, which features simple navigation and a convenient word and phrase search function, users can quickly answer questions about every Rule, Definition and Decision. The new technology is the only Rules application approved by the USGA. 
“The USGA strives to deliver our best content wherever and whenever the golf audience needs it,” said Alex Withers, managing director of digital media for the USGA. “Having an interactive smart phone App for the Rules of Golf is a natural extension to better serve golfers across the U.S. and Mexico.”
Users can also e-mail the USGA directly from the application with a Rules question. This mobile App now gives golfers a new way to seek answers from the USGA, which answers more than 15,000 Rules questions each year.
“The Rules of Golf are an integral part of the game,” said Jeff Hall, managing director of rules and competitions for the USGA. “Providing those Rules in a variety of mediums is exciting for the USGA and better serves all golfers.” 
The iPhone was the ideal initial platform for the application given the vast distribution of iPhone applications. The USGA plans to extend the application onto the BlackBerry and Google Android operating systems later this month. 
Users can purchase and download the Rules of Golf App in the iTunes store for $3.99. The direct link for users with iTunes, an iPhone or iPod touch is http://iTunes.com/apps/therulesofgolf.
