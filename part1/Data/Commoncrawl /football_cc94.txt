Sam Allardyce has confirmed West Ham are keen to sign Joleon Lescott from Manchester City.
The Hammers have slipped to second from bottom in the Premier League after a disastrous run of form and were humiliated by Championship side Notingham Forest in the FA Cup on Sunday.
Allardyce admits he is desperate to add to his injury-hit squad this month as he bids to reverse his side’s slump, and has revealed Lescott is one of this top targets.
City are reportedly ready to let the central defender leave the Etihad Stadium on loan, and Allardyce said: “I don’t know if Joleon is available, but if it is possible I would like to get him.”
