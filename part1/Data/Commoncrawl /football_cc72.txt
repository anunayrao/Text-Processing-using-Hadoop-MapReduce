Manchester United are eager to rival Inter Milan in their pursuit of Mexican winger Jurgen Damm.
The 23-year-old, who currently plies his trade in his home country for Tigres, has been monitored closely by scouts from a host of European clubs.
According to Tutto Mercato, Inter were the clear favourites to land Damm but United have now firmed up their interest by making contact with Tigres and the player’s representatives.
Jose Mourinho is understood to be a fan of Damm’s versatility, with the player enhancing his reputation as a winger who can operate on either flank.
Damm already has three international caps to his name and is now eyeing a move across the Atlantic.
United are also encouraged by the fact there will be no visa issues when negotiating a deal for Damm, who has a German passport courtesy of his grandfather.
