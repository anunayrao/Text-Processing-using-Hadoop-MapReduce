The patch, which will be worn on the right sleeves of jerseys, features "MLB" in black and "150" in red surrounding the MLB logo."We're excited to recognize the 150th anniversary of professional baseball by honoring our history while celebrating the game and the great players of today," Commissioner Rob Manfred said. "The MLB 150 patch will be a continuous reminder on the field of the link everyone involved in the game today has with the storied history of professional baseball and MLB."
