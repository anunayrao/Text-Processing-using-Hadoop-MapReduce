Manchester United midfielder Anderson is set to wrap up a loan move to Fiorentina.
The Brazilian cost the Premier League champions Â£20million back in 2007 from Porto.
He has made 179 appearances, scoring 9 goals, but has failed to impress in his six seasons at Old Trafford and has only featured four times in the Premier League under new boss David Moyes.
He will now look to rekindle his career in Italy at Fiorentina, who are currently fourth in Serie A, with Moyes happy to sanction a loan move for the rest of the season.
The 25-year-old has travelled to Florence to undergo a medical and the deal will be rubber-stamped after the relevant paperwork is completed.
