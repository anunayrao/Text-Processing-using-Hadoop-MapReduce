In 2012, BTF launched the BTF/MLB Field Maintenance Education Program. This program provides the opportunity for MLB groundskeepers to share tips and techniques with other professional sports turf managers, coaches, parents and volunteers who are involved in the maintenance of youth baseball and softball fields.
In conjunction with the clinics, the Baseball Tomorrow Fund awards a $10,000 grant to a local organization selected by the participating Club. The grant funds are used for the purchase of field maintenance supplies, equipment or services.
