Manchester United have tabled a £34million bid for Real Madrid playmaker James Rodriguez, according to reports in Spain.
The Colombia star has dropped well down the pecking order at the Bernabeu since Zinedine Zidane took charge and his opportunities are again expected to be limited next season.
According to Don Balon, Jose Mourinho is keen to add James as an attacking option to his squad next season and has sanctioned a bid.
Paris Saint-Germain and West Ham have also registered an interest in the 25-year-old but it now appears United are best-placed to land him.
Real president Florentino Perez would prefer to keep hold of James due to his commercial value, but Zidane has apparently stepped in and told his boss that the player’s services are no longer required in the Spanish capital.
