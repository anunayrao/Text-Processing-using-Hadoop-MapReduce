Arsenal chief executive Ivan Gazidis has said the club “need to win” major trophies and are constantly feeling the pressure to deliver them.
The Gunners have not won the Premier League since their famous unbeaten season 12 years ago and ended a nine-year wait for a major honour when they won the FA Cup in 2014.
They went on to defend it in 2015 but have still yet to record another Premier League crown, while they have fallen at the round of 16 in the Champions League for the past six years.
Arsene Wenger’s side were top of the table at the turn of the year but ended up finishing in second place, 10 points adrift of champions Leicester.
And Gazidis, who said last week the club will not break the bank to sign players, knows Arsenal need to go one better this time around.
“We need to win the major titles, and we feel that pressure every day,” he told the New York Times.
“And so for us, there is a sense of disappointment and frustration that last season we finished in second place. Second place isn’t what we’re aiming for. We’re aiming to win it.
“Achieving consistency provides us with the opportunity to compete at that level and try to win it every year, and that’s obviously a good thing.
“But that’s not our objective. Our objective is to win the major trophies, and to put the club in a position where it can consistently compete for the major trophies. And I would add, very importantly for us, to do it in a way that’s consistent with our club values.”
