John Isner was a 10-year-old living in Greensboro, N.C., when the Carolina Panthers franchise was created. He's been a fan ever since.
The giant of American tennis, and the sport's resident marathon expert, has had star receiver Steve Smith watch matches from his player's box and has visited the team's training camp. So it was only natural that when Isner won his first Grand Slam match since the start of last football season, he'd pay homage to the team's sensational rookie quarterback, Cam Newton.

After defeating David Nalbandian 4-6, 6-3, 2-6, 7-6, 10-8 in a controversial second-round match in the Australian Open, Isner jogged to the middle of the court, turned to fans and performed Newton's signature touchdown dance, a take on Clark Kent revealing his Superman outfit.
Isner will play No. 18 seed Feliciano Lopez on Friday. If he's smart, the Chilean will back some Kryptonite in his tennis bag, just in case.
