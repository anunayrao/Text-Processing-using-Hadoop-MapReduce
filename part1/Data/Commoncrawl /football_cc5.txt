Barcelona have stepped up their interest in Manchester United and Arsenal target Ilkay Gundogan after holding further talks with the player’s camp, according to German newspaper Bild.
Gundogan, who is currently sidelined with a back injury, is one of Europe’s most coveted midfielders having starred for Dortmund following his 2011 move from Nuremberg.
He is inside the final 18 months of his contract at Dortmund and revealed earlier this week that everything is “open” over his future.
talkSPORT told you back in December that Barcelona had met the player’s father Irfan, and it is now claimed that the Catalan side have met on more than one occasion with him and the player’s cousin Ilfay to discuss a possible deal.
Gundogan has frequently been suggested as a solution for Manchester United’s long-standing midfield woes, while Arsene Wenger is reportedly a big fan of the Germany international too.
The 23-year-old is also on the radar of Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti – indeed it was reported earlier this season that the Bernabeu giants had secured a first-refusal option on the midfielder.
