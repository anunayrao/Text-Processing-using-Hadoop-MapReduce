On Thursday at Wimbledon, Marion Bartoli advanced to her second ever Wimbledon final with a convincing win over Kristen Flipkens. That semifinal win might have been expected, but something that ESPN brought to our attention during the telecast was a number that had a lot of us doing a double take.
Bartoli is apparently a pretty smart young woman, so smart that her IQ is higher than that of notables like Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking.
The average American IQ is 98, the same average as in France, so Bartoli is well above that number. Her IQ of 175 has her in the top 0.0003 percent of the world, so yeah, that's a staggering number from a pretty darn good tennis player.
But, we wouldn't be doing our job if we didn't give you the best quote ever about Intelligent Quotient, by a man on the list you see above.
"People who boast about their I.Q. are losers," Stephen Hawking once said. Take that, Bartoli!
