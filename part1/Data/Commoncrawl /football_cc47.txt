Marko Arnautovic has signed a new four-year deal with Stoke City. 
The Austria international, the Potters’ top-scorer and players’ player of the year last season, had been linked with a move to Everton but has ended speculation over his future.
The 27-year-old has been a hit at the Bet365 Stadium since his arrival from Werder Bremen in 2013 and had one year remaining on his previous contract.
