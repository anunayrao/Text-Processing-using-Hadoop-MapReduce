Appearing on Channel Ten's 'The Project', Tomic labelled Tennis Australia "corrupt" and said he doesn't care what Davis Cup captain Hewitt thinks of him.

Hewitt criticised the 25-year-old on Tuesday, claiming Tennis Australia had "bent over backwards" in trying to help Tomic before running out of patience with him.
On Wednesday night, Tomic fired back.
"I don't care what Lleyton said, I never lost to him," Tomic said.
"There's a reason why I played Davis Cup at the youngest age for Australia in history.
"There's a reason why my record stands that good.
"I stand by my call. They know they can't win without me. I know they can't without me."
Tomic then wished his teammates good luck in the upcoming tie against Germany and said he would like to play for his country in the future but likened Tennis Australia to FIFA.
When asked to clarify if he meant that Tennis Australia was corrupt, Tomic doubled down.
"Yeah absolutely and I stand by that call," Tomic said
"This is a statement I standby and only those people know what I'm talking about.
"It's up to only them to fix...we have a few wrong people in that organisation and I hope that can change and I hope the best players can be playing Davis Cup again."
