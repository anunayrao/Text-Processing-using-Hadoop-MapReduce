Arsenal are running out of time in their bid to sign top players as they attempt to mount another Premier League title challenge, fears former star Frank McLintock.
The Gunners have added three players to their ranks this summer with Granit Xhaka signing in a £30million deal, while Rob Holding and Takuma Asano have also joined but are considered ones for the future.
Many supporters and pundits believe if Arsenal are to challenge for the Premier League, which they haven’t won since 2004, this season they need to add at least two more world-class talent to their ranks.
But with the campaign just 18 days away, McLintock is worried about their chances.
He told the Alan Brazil Sports Breakfast: “I think Arsenal fans have got their hands ready to grab him by the throat and ask him why he isn’t buying a centre forward, a midfield player and a centre-half, especially with Per Mertesacker injured.
“They’re talking about being in for Riyad Mahrez but all the other top clubs appear to have bought three or four players in the last month or so and are all getting settled down and ready for the new season. Yet we’re still looking and trying to get a last minute buy, which seems crazy.
“You’re running out of time and running out of players to go for. That’s the problem.”
He added: “It’s very hard to think who will win the Premier League this year.
“I actually, if Arsene Wenger doesn’t buy a couple of top players, don’t think they’re going to be strong enough [to challenge]. I think they might be in the top four again and it’s going to be harder than it was last season, that’s for sure.”
