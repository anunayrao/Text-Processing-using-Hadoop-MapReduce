The grand jury investigation is the first indication criminal charges may be filed in a scandal that has already led to sweeping changes in the football recruiting program and could cost some university officials their jobs. 
Legal experts said they think investigators are trying to figure out whether the money came from university funds. 
"It is illegal to facilitate prostitution and it is probably illegal to spend state money on prostitutes," said Craig Silverman, a former Denver prosecutor who has been following the case. 
The grand jury met for 2 1/2 hours to hear testimony about high-profile allegations surrounding the state's flagship school in Boulder and will meet again June 11, bailiff Don Colaizzi said. One of the three witnesses left with a coat over her head. 
Among those testifying was Pasha Cowan, who has said Colorado recruiting aide Nathan Maxcey paid her former escort service hundreds of dollars. She said nothing to reporters outside the grand jury room. 
Cowan is a former manager of the Best Variety escort service, which was allegedly hired to go to a Broomfield hotel where football recruits are often housed during visits to the campus in nearby Boulder. 
Her attorney, Mark Johnson, later said his client has told police and attorneys handling federal lawsuits against the school that Maxcey hired escorts for football athletes. 
"It wasn't a very difficult conclusion to draw that they were football players — young, about the right age, their conditioning and the fact that Nathan Maxcey bragged (to Cowan) that he was in the recruiting department," Johnson said told The Associated Press. 
Each call girl charged $250 per encounter, Johnson said. 
"Either Cowan is a liar or Maxcey had a boat load of cash that he was paying to an escort service when he was only making about two grand a month," Johnson said. "It's not my job to sort out the truth." 
Maxcey did not return a message left at his parents' Texas home. He has repeatedly denied hiring escorts for players or recruits, saying any sexual liaisons were for him. 
Attorney General Ken Salazar, at the governor's request, has been investigating whether criminal charges are warranted in the scandal, which includes allegations of sexual assault and questions about the use of university funds. 
Last week, Salazar decided against charges in nine alleged assaults by football players or recruits, citing evidentiary concerns and the reluctance of the women to go forward with the cases. The assault allegations date to at least 1997. 
Earlier this week, a Board of Regents investigative commission concluded that university officials did not condone any misconduct but repeatedly failed to properly oversee the athletics department. 
The commission, which lacked subpoena power, also urged the attorney general to look into the circumstances surrounding Maxcey, who was a football recruiting aide from June 2002 to July 2003. 
According to the commission, three call girls from Best Variety said Maxcey paid them at least $2,000 in cash over a 45-day period "and arranged sex for other young men" at the Broomfield hotel. 
Maxcey's duties included picking up recruits and checking them in at the hotel, the Omni Interlocken. 
A recent university audit found Maxcey made nearly $1,200 worth of calls to an escort service and a chat line from his school-issued cell phone. He has repaid the university some $900. 
Director of football operations David Hansburg in February said Cowan told him about Maxcey's sexual liaisons during a call in which she asked for a job. According to Hansburg, Cowan said, "I'm not trying to blackmail you." 
That same month, Hardbodies Entertainment Inc. of Denver, said athletes at Colorado and universities around the country had been paying its strippers to entertain recruits for years. Company president Steve Lower said then that his strippers had been hired for Colorado recruits as recently as two weeks earlier. 
On Friday, Lower said he was told by the regents' commission he would probably be subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury. 
Investigators, Lower said, are interested in who paid for strippers at parties for football recruits. 
"The coaches didn't pay for this, it didn't come from anything but just the guys pooling their money together," Lower said. "I think after 20 years, I can figure that out. You put 20 guys in a room and it's not hard to come up with $250. You can come up with what you need, whether it's food or strippers." 
According to the commission, the university provides a $30-per-day entertainment stipend to player-hosts for unstructured activities such as movies or bowling. 
University President Elizabeth Hoffman is reviewing the commission report and plans to make recommendations to the regents by the end of the month. Among other things, she is expected to decide on the future of athletics director Dick Tharp and football coach Gary Barnett, who has been suspended since Feb. 18 for remarks he made in two of the alleged assaults. 
Still pending are federal lawsuits filed by three women who say they were raped by recruits or players at or just after an off-campus party in December 2001. Boulder County prosecutor Mary Keenan's allegation that the school uses sex and alcohol to entice recruits — made in a deposition for one of the suits — helped spark the scandal earlier this year. 
The lawsuits accuse Colorado of failing to protect the women under federal Title IX gender equity law. They seek unspecified damages.
