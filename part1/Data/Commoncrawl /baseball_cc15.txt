Developing the next generation of leaders starts with a strong foundation in health and fitness. The Cubs work with several organizations to emphasize the values of physical fitness through baseball and softball.
Education empowers communities. Providing children and young adults with the support and resources needed to excel in school creates a positive learning environment and opens a wealth of opportunities for our next generation of leaders. The Cubs support citywide programs that promote education and college persistence.
An active community is a healthy community. It offers youth the chance to play while supporting sportsmanship and encouraging members of the community to become active as coaches, mentors, caretakers and allies.
The McCormick Foundation, through its fund Cubs Care, has granted more than $22 million to Chicago nonprofit organizations since 1991. Cubs Care grants are awarded to designated 501(c)(3) organizations. Grant consideration is given to organizations that have been in existence for at least three years and request support for programs in operation for at least a year.
