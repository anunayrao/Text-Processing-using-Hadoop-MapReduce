West Bromwich Albion are set to make an improved offer for Leicester City winger Jeff Schlupp.
The Baggies have already seen a £9million bid rejected by the Premier League champions, but boss Tony Pulis is keen to land the powerful wide man as he looks to reshape his squad at the Hawthorns.
Schlupp, 23, started 14 league games as the Foxes won the title last season ahead of Arsenal and Tottenham. But with City boss Claudio Ranieri keen to add Polish winger Bartosz Kapustka to his ranks, the academy product could find his opportunities even more limited next season.
Kaptska currently plays for Cracovia in Poland and clubs from Europe’s elite leagues have been on red alert following his stand out performances for his nation at Euro 2016.
Ghana international Schlupp has three years left on his current deal at the King Power earning a reported £40,000 per week and if the move is complete he can expect to feature prominently for the Baggies next term.
Meanwhile, Pulis is still chasing Brighton defender Lewis Dunk. The Seagulls rejected an initial bid of £8million but are braced for another bid from the Premier League side for the 24-year-old stopper.
