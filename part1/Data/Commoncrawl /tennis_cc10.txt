After a poor run of injuries in his last three showings, Nick Kyrgios has returned to the winners circle with a 6-1 6-2 against world number 45 Viktor Troicki.

Kyrgios was plagued by both a hip and shoulder injury at the Queen's tournament, Wimbledon and most recently at the Citi Open in Washington where he was booed off the court by fans.

Although he knocked off Troicki in just 51 minutes, Kyrgios admits his injuries are still bothering him.
"I'm feeling it all the time," Kyrgios said.
"It's not something that is just going to heal. I can compete so that's the most I can do at the moment."
Injuries aside, the 22-year-old was pleased to get back into form as he prepares his bid for the US Open.
"I just wanted to come out here and try and get the win," he said.
"I've been struggling the last couple of months.
"He's (Troicki) been struggling as well with injuries so all the best to him but I'm just happy to get out here and get a win."
