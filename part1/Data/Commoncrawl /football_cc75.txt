Brendan Rodgers says he is “working hard” to bolster Liverpool’s squad but admits it could be difficult to bring in new faces this month.
Liverpool arguably had the most success of any Premier League club during the last January transfer window when they signed Daniel Sturridge and Philippe Coutinho.
The Reds are firmly in the hunt for a Champions League place and Rodgers has been tipped to bring in reinforcements to strengthen their grip on a top-four spot.
FC Basel winger Mohamed Salah and Porto midfielder Fernando have been touted as potential targets, but Rodgers feels it will be tough to complete any deals before the window slams shut at the end of the month.
He said: “It could be a difficult one to improve the squad but we are working hard.”
Meanwhile, Rodgers will be boosted this weekend by the return from injury of Joe Allen ahead of Aston Villa’s visit to Anfield.
France defender Mamadou Sakho is still an injury doubt, however, while full-backs Jose Enrique and Jon Flanagan remain on the sidelines.
