Inter Milan are considering a swoop for Chelsea target Victor Lindelof, according to reports in Italy.
The versatile Swedish defender has been heavily linked with a move from Benfica to Stamford Bridge this summer as Antonio Conte eyes up a long-term replacement for club captain John Terry.
talkSPORT reported last week that Chelsea had made an approach for the 22-year-old but it appears they are no closer to sealing a deal.
And now, according to Calcio Mercato, Inter are ready to match any offer Chelsea put on the table.
It is understood that Lindelof’s release clause at the Estadio da Luz is set at around £25m but Benfica could be tempted to sell for less.
Chelsea are willing to shell out £22m on the centre-back and a bidding war with Inter could take place in the coming days.
