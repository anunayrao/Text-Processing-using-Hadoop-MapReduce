After leading in the first set 5-0, Gavrilova collapsed to lose the match 7-5 6-3. 

In response to a heap of frustrated Australians, Gavrilova changed the privacy on her Instagram so only people she followed could comment on her posts. 
"Thanks everyone who keeps supporting me and for all your sweet messages," Gavrilova wrote. 
"And... shhh to all the betting people... I coped (sic) it hard last night.
"Only people I follow can comment on my posts now... so my family doesn't see all the 'love' I get."
Aussie Dasha was inundated with obscene comments from punters who had placed money on her getting through to the third round. 
Fellow Australian player Sam Stosur praised Gavrilova, outlining that online trolls are becoming a "big problem around the world". 
"I think a lot of it's due to gambling in tennis, they obviously lose some money on you and they're not happy about it," Stosur said. 
"I haven't been on it (social media) for a while and there's a reason for that because this type of stuff can happen." 
Gavrilova, ranked 23rd in the world, enjoys using her social media to interact with her fans. 
She took to Twitter after the match to get her followers' thoughts on a controversial call which saw her not allowed to make a challenge at a crucial point of the match.
