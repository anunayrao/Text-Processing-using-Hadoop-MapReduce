Everton have bolstered their attacking options by snapping up Spartak Moscow winger Aiden McGeady.
Roberto Martinez has long been an admirer of the Republic of Ireland international and the Toffees announced his capture by parading him in front of surprised fans at Goodison Park before their game against Norwich.
The former Celtic man, 27, arrives with plenty of international and Champions League experience and has penned a four-and-a-half year deal.
It was suggested McGeady may sign a pre-contract to move to Merseyside this summer but Martinez worked hard to get his man immediately.
He spent six trophy laden years at Celtic before making a Â£9.5million move to Russia in 2010.
His switch to Goodison Park sees him link-up with international teammates Seamus Coleman, James McCarthy and Darron Gibson.
