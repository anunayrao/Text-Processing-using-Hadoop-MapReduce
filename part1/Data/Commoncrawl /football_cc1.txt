Lazio are on the verge of completing a loan deal for Newcastle flop Florian Thauvin, according to reports in Italy.
The Frenchman only arrived at St James’ Park last summer and was shipped out on loan to Marseille after an unconvincing first sixth months in England.
Marseille had tried to agree a permanent deal for Thauvin earlier this summer but their offer was well below Newcastle’s valuation.
However, according to Gazzetta dello Sport, Lazio are prepared to pay Newcastle £1.6m to take him on loan for a year with an agreement to pay the Magpies a further £9m should they wish to keep him beyond next summer.
Newcastle are keen to get Thauvin off their books as soon as possible as they try to rejuggle their finances following their relegation to the Championship.
