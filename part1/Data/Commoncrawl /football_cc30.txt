Stoke City remain keen on signing West Bromwich Albion striker Saido Berahino, chairman Peter Coates has told talkSPORT.
The forward, once linked with a switch to Tottenham Hotspur, has been the subject of bids from the Potters worth £16million and £20million, according to reports
And Coates has revealed they do still want to land the 22-year-old striker.
“We’re after that elusive striker everyone is looking for,” he told the Alan Brazil Sports Breakfast.
“Players like to see new faces and the club moving on. Although it might affect their position, they still want to feel you’re improving.
“[Saido Berahino] is on our list. We would like to do something. We’re in the hands of the player and West Bromwich Albion at the minute and we’re working away on it.
“We would like to take him if a deal can be done.”
Meanwhile, Coates has assuaged supporters’ fears surrounding the future of Austria international Marko Arnautovic, who was reportedly wanted by Everton.
He said: “He [Arnautovic] is an exceptional talent and he was our leading goalscorer last season so we’re naturally keen to keep him and we think that will happen.”
