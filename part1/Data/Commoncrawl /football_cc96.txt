West Ham insist Ravel Morrison does not appear to be planning a strike after the club turned down a bid from Fulham for the England Under-21 playmaker.
The Hammers made a complaint to the Premier League after Fulham manager Rene Meulensteen declared that Morrison wants to join him in west London.
It was since reported that the former Manchester United starlet, 20, will go on strike to force through a move to Craven Cottage.
But West Ham assistant manager Neil McDonald insists Morrison seems as happy as ever – and challenged him to hold down a place in the first team.
McDonald said: “There seems to be a story about Rav every week.
“The lad comes in and trains, sometimes he has had a little bit of a groin injury, but we’ve man-managed that. He trained yesterday with a huge, big smile on his face with the rest of the squad so that [going on strike] is news to me.
And when asked whether West Ham want to keep Morrison, he replied: “Well, why not? But he needs to get into the team and he needs to be consistent.
“He had a great run of three or four games where he was outstanding but he’s a young kid and he’s still learning the game. He goes through inconsistency to a certain extent and he’s had a little bit of a groin injury as well so that’s stop and start.
“We look forward to him being in the squad on Saturday, he should be fit, he’s been training with the lads and he’s brought a lot of joy, especially with winning against Cardiff – he cheered everyone up when he came back as well.”
