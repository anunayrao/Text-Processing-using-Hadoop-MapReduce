B.A.T. President Randy Winn has been involved with the Baseball Assistance Team for 14 years, the last four as President. He has a passion for giving back, demonstrated through his dedication in helping members of the Baseball Family in need. He has seen the organization grow in reach, in number of people that are being helped and in dollars that are being spent on those in need. The common theme Randy speaks about is the Baseball Family.
"We continue to be grateful to the entire industry, especially Major League Baseball, the Clubs and the MLB Players Association, for their unwavering support," said Winn.
