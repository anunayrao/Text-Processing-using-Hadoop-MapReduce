The theme of Wimbledon in 2013 continued on Monday, as Serena Williams, the No. 1 seed and heavy, heavy favorite to snag her sixth Grand Slam on grass was upset by Sabine Lisicki in the fourth round.
Lisicki won 6-2, 1-6, 6-4, ending Serena's 34-match winning streak and advancing to the quarterfinals for the second straight year at Wimbledon.
What was the most impressive part about Lisicki's win? Well for starters, this win marks the fourth time that she has been able to come to Wimbledon and beat the reigning French Open champion. On top of that, Lisicki was down 3-0 in the final set after getting trounced in the second set, and it looked like it was all but over for the German before finding another gear and leveling the final set at four games each.
Serena had twice as many break point opportunities as Lisicki throughout the match but was only able to convert 31 percent of those chances while Lisicki's percentage was much higher at 63 percent. Lisicki was also about to hit as many aces as Serena, and had 10 more winners than the defending champion.
Williams now joins a list of big names bounced from the 2013 Wimbledon tournament that includes Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Maria Sharapova.
Asked after her match about her upcoming opponent in the quarterfinals, Kaia Kanepi, Lisicki said while fighting back tears that she was not thinking about that and was going to enjoy this moment.
