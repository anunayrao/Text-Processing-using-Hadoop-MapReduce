After Nick Kyrgios bemoaned his decision to play doubles during a tight third-round win over Jo-Wilfried Tsonga at the Australian Open, former world no.1 Jim Courier believes it is a mistake to play both.

Though triumphing in four sets against his French opponent on Friday night, Kyrgios openly questioned his decision compete in the doubles at one stage during the match.
"Why the f*** am I playing doubles," he said. 
"Hours in 50 degree heat ... really good management."

Set to take to the court with fellow Aussie Matt Reid at 2pm on Saturday, less than 24 hours after beating Tsonga, Courier criticised Kyrgios for not giving himself every chance to succeed in the singles.
"If Nick thinks he has a serious chance to win a major, he does need to stop playing doubles," Courier said on Channel Seven.
"It is a mistake to play.
"All the players who think they have a serious chance to win majors in singles skip the doubles.
"They just do it because you can get caught out best of five and then you are backing that up."
Kyrgios faces a fourth-round clash against third seed Grigor Dimitrov on Sunday, meaning with the doubles, he will have played six games in a week.
