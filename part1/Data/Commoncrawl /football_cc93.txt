Benfica are ready to swoop for Tottenham midfielder Nabil Bentaleb.
The Algerian’s future at White Hart Lane is in doubt after manager Mauricio Pochettino revealed he is not in his plans for the upcoming season.
That news has put several clubs on red alert and, according to A Bola, Benfica are one of those ready to make a move.
The Portuguese club are in need of a new central midfielder after Renato Sanches joined Bayern Munich for £27.5million earlier this summer.
At 21, Bentaleb is seen as an ideal replacement and Benfica are ready to open talks with Tottenham this week.
Given the fact that Pochettino has publicly stated that Bentaleb is not part of his plans, it is reported that he can be snapped up for £10million.
