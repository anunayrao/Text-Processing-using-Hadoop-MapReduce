Steve Sidwell has defended under-fire teammate Dimitar Berbatov and insists Fulham need the mercurial striker if they are to beat the drop.
Berbatov has frustrated fans with his performances this season and has been tipped to leave the struggling Cottagers in this transfer window.
Arsenal have been suggested as possible suitors for the 32-year-old, but Sidwell wants the former Manchester United star to stay as he believes his creative qualities are still much-needed.
“His vision, his touch, what he can produce week in, week out to win games for you, it’s there to see. He did that last season. He won numerous games with the goals he scored,” said the midfielder, speaking on the Alan Brazil Sports Breakfast.
“This year, perhaps because he hasn’t scored as many as he would have liked, it comes down to what else he is producing on the pitch. So, if he has not scored, they look at his work rate, the chances he has created. Obviously we haven’t had a great run of form this year as a team and he can’t be the brunt of that.
“You always want your best players to stay, wherever you are in the Premier League. Whether you are at the bottom, in the middle, or pushing for the championship, you want your best players to be there because you know on their day what they can produce.”
