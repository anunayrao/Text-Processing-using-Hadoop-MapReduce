INDIAN WELLS, CA, USA - No.6 seed Elina Svitolina claimed an epic win over Ashleigh Barty in the fourth round of the BNP Paribas Open in three close sets, 7-6(8), 5-7, 6-4, to reach the BNP Paribas Open quarterfinals - and break a WTA season record in the process.
At three hours and 12 minutes, the match clocks in as the longest women’s match of 2019, but Svitolina assured press at Indian Wells that it felt like much, much longer while she was fighting on court.
“Actually, it did feel pretty long, because we had long rallies and long games,” she said, before adding with a laugh, “It actually felt longer than three hours and 12 minutes.”

The key to securing the victory - and her career-first spot in the Indian Wells quarterfinals - was Svitolina’s fitness, which has helped the World No.6 edge through in many tough battles.
“I always trust my fitness,” Svitolina explained. “I know that I can play good matches, and I'm physically strong. It's one of my strengths, I would say. So I have just to trust it.
“You know, I was working before coming here on my fitness. So, I just had to go out there and try to stay tough and fight until the very last point, and it really helped me today.”
