College football's postseason primarily is about championships. For coaches, it's also about bonuses. In the $3 million-a-year, national-title-contender realm, it can be double what Brady Hoke, coach of undefeated Ball State, makes in salary ($240,000). But even Hoke has added $20,000, and he could get $7,500 more for winning the Mid-American Conference title and a non-BCS bowl.Note: Figures do not include bonuses or potential bonuses for coach of the year awards or team academic performance.Nick Saban, AlabamaEarned or nearly assured:$75,000: in SEC title game$125,000: in BCS non-title game$200,000On the table:$50,000 more: win SEC title$75,000 more: play for BCS title$200,000 more: win BCS title$325,000Mack Brown, Texas Nearly assured:$100,000: in BCS game$100,000What he missed out on:$50,000: in Big 12 title gameChance for $100,000 more for winning Big 12 title$150,000On the table:(By final rank in USA TODAY or Associated Press poll)$450,000: No. 1 or tied for No. 1$100,000: No. 2, 3 or tied for No. 3$50,000: No. 4, 5 or tied for No. 5$25,000: No. 6-10 or tied for No. 10$450,000Bob Stoops, Oklahoma Earned or nearly assured:$60,000: in Big 12 title game$50,000: top 20 in final BCS rankings$65,000: in non-BCS bowl game$175,000

Two spots are set: Big Ten champion Penn State in the Rose and Big East champ Cincinnati in, likely, the Orange. 
As for the championship game, the pairing basically comes down to the winner of Saturday's Alabama-Florida game against Oklahoma, if it wins Saturday night against Missouri. If Oklahoma loses, Texas probably would move up. 
USA TODAY's Thomas O'Toole looks at the ins and outs of the final weekend: 
What's next 
Sunday, BCS officials will take two polls of human voters — USA TODAY coaches and Harris Interactive — and combine them with an average of six computer rankings — with high and low computer ranks tossed out — and come up with scores that place teams in order. The top two meet in the FedEx BCS title game Jan. 8 in Miami. Others will be slotted in remaining games. The selection order begins by putting six conference champs in bowls where they are contractually obligated. These are known as anchor teams: Atlantic Coast to the Orange, Big Ten and Pacific-10 to the Rose, Big 12 to the Fiesta, Southeastern to the Sugar. 
Bowls losing anchor teams to the title game are allowed to replace them from the at-large pool in order of the highest-ranked team lost. For example, if Alabama is in the title game, the Sugar Bowl will be able to fill a spot first because the SEC champ is its anchor and Alabama is ranked No. 1. If Oklahoma is also in, for example, then the Fiesta Bowl is allowed to fill a spot because it lost the Big 12 champ. After that, the remaining spots are filled in a prearranged order. This year: Fiesta, Sugar, Orange. (The Rose has its spots filled by conference champs.) 
Non-BCS bowls that still have openings will then fill their spots, though many of those pairings probably will be made by Sunday.
Good omens 
In every year of the BCS except the first in 1998, at least one of the top two teams in the initial standings was in the title game. Also, 19 of the 20 teams that have played in the BCS title game were among the top six of the initial standings. So history favors:
•Alabama. No. 2 in the initial standings Oct. 19. Might make being an underdog as the nation's No. 1 a little easier to handle.
•Oklahoma. No. 4 in the initial standings.
•Texas. No. 1 in the initial standings.
History is not on the side of Florida, No. 10 in the initial standings. The only team to make the title game from outside the top six of the initial standings was No. 12 LSU in 2003, but the Tigers won the championship.
Consensus of 12 USA TODAY college writers and editors: Oklahoma vs. Florida.
Unbeaten, uninvited 
While Utah (12-0) has virtually clinched a bid, two other currently undefeated teams from outside the six main conferences probably will not play in the major games. Boise State (12-0) and Ball State (12-0 going into Friday night's Mid-American title game) are in the at-large pool by virtue of their spots among the top 12 of the standings, but the major bowls are almost certain to go with established powers when the picks are made. The only others to be unbeaten but not be in a BCS game: Tulane (1998), Marshall (1999), Boise State (2004).
Payout 
About $18 million to each entrant's conference to be disbursed by each league's revenue-sharing plan; $4.5 million for a second entry from one league.
