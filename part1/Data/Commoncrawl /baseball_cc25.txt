Hi all! My name is Matt Doughty and I am joining the Baseball Assistance Team as an intern in the summer of 2018. I graduated from the University of Virginia in May, where I was a Public Policy and Leadership major and sidearm pitcher on the 2015 College World Series championship team. After I stopped playing baseball in the spring of 2016, I interned in sports information for the Virginia basketball program and tried to volunteer for charities and student organizations around campus.
My father and sister both work in college sports and have been very influential in my desire to work in sports. I started playing t-ball in my hometown of Roanoke, Virginia, at the age of 4 and have loved the game since. Baseball gave me countless friends, unforgettable memories and an athletic outlet for my competitive spirit. At the end of my career, I did not know if I would ever have a connection to the sport I love again, but I am excited to work with B.A.T and give back to the sport that gave so much to me. In a game that is so predicated on failure, I hope to bring more success stories to baseball through B.A.T.
