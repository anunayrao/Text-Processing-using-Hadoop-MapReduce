For months, the hottest ticket in London has been to the 100-meter men's final at the upcoming Olympics. Usain Bolt and Yohan Blake are taking a backseat for the next 48 hours to Roger Federer and Andy Murray.
Murray's quest to become the first British man to win Wimbledon since 1936 is driving up ticket prices to Sunday's final to unprecedented levels. As of 5 p.m. ET on Friday, the highest-priced ticket on British ticketing site viagogo.uk was going for $21,000.

The most expensive ticket sold to Super Bowl XLV was $15,002.
Playing Federer, a longtime favorite of Centre Court fans who's pursuing his seventh Wimbledon title, isn't hurting resale value either.
"I always say in whatever country I am, I like to play the local hero," Federer told reporters, "and Andy is exactly that here at Wimbledon."
