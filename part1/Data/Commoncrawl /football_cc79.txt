Dave Merrington believes Southampton face a fight to hold on to their top stars following Nicola Cortese’s departure.
The Saints chairman resigned from his position on Wednesday after reportedly falling out with owner Katharina Liebherr, who took over the club when her father, Swiss businessman Markus Liebherr, died in 2010.
Youngster Luke Shaw has been linked with a move to Chelsea or Manchester United, while star striker Rickie Lambert could be on his way to West Ham.
And former manager Merrington claims clubs may try to unsettle players during this turbulent time at the south coast side.
“Whatever people’s opinions of Nicola Cortese are, you cannot deny his drive helped Southampton get into the Premier League,” he told Hawksbee and Jacobs. “He helped set up the progressive youth academy, was a hard-nosed businessman and wasn’t easy to deal with during negotiations.
“People knew there was no way clubs would get players out of Southampton easily.
“Now, with him gone, they need to steady the ship very quickly. If the club becomes unstable, there are already major clubs looking at some of the good players here.
“If they sniff an opportunity to get their foot in the door, if they feel the club’s future might be slightly in doubt, then they’ll be trying to get them out of there.”
