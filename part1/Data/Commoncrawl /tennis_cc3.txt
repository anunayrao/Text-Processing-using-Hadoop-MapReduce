American tennis star Coco Vandeweghe has been slapped with a hefty $10,000 fine for her foul-mouthed flare-up in the first round of the Australian Open.

The world number nine was hit with a breach for unsportsmanlike conduct for an expletive-laden rant where she was heard telling opponent Timea Babos to "F*** off you f***ing b***h".
Chair umpire Fergus Murphy handed down two code violations, one of which evolved from a tantrum from the impassioned American over bananas.

She refused to start the second set until someone brought her a piece of fruit, claiming she was ''ill-prepared'' to return to the court.

Vandeweghe argued she was suffering from a bout of the flu and requested for her first round encounter to be delayed.
But Babos wasn't having any of her excuses.
''The second one I believe was an insult against me. If the umpire heard it then it must have been this," Babos said after the match.
14 players haves been fined in the tournament thus far.
Nick Kyrgios is the only Australian to be punished with a $3000 fine following his outburst at a fan where he told them to "shut the f*** up".
