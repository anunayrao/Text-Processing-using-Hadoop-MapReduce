Two excruciatingly long years ago.
Michigan arrives Saturday for the 101st renewal of one of the grandest rivalries in all of sport. The Buckeyes, however, are 6-4 and far removed from the rankings and a shot at any kind of title. They merely aim to be spoilers, denying the seventh-ranked Wolverines an outright Big Ten Conference championship and a second berth in a row in the Rose Bowl.
That might qualify as crisis — "At Ohio State, you don't expect to lose like that," star linebacker A.J. Hawk says — but the Buckeyes have redefined that  term off the field.
An NCAA investigation of the football program, thought finished 10 months ago, is restarted after former star Maurice Clarett's fusillade of allegations last week, including academic fraud. Violations were admitted during the summer in men's basketball, and Ohio State is conceding eventual sanctions there. Fired coach Jim O'Brien threw in another complication, claiming wrongful termination and suing for at least $3.4 million in lost pay.
Pepper that with a spate of football run-ins with the law, one ending in former tight end Louis Irizarry's plea of guilty last month to felony robbery. Current team captain and one-time starting tailback Lydell Ross sat out two October games while police checked out a complaint that he used fake in-house currency at a local strip club. He was cleared of any crime but not of the embarrassment of frequenting the place.
No matter the NCAA verdicts, the pileup of distasteful headlines is weighing on a school that would prefer the focus be on its 10th freshman class in a row with the highest-ever academic credentials, record research funding and more than $558 million in ongoing capital projects.
"No one at the university can feel happy about this because it's such a distraction," says Jack Rall, a professor in the department of physiology and cell biology.
A former chairman of the faculty Athletic Council who now heads the Faculty Council, Rall is supportive of the athletics staff and coaches, including football coach Jim Tressel. He was part of the committee that interviewed Tressel before he was hired in January 2001 and says he believes him to be a good and honest man.
Even so, Rall worries, "This fits with people's conceptions of the abuses of big-time sports. ... It's a public relations disaster.
"I don't know quite how to trace the history of this, whether it's related to Woody Hayes being a very colorful figure. But Ohio State has always had this football-factory image. And it really hinders the good story we have to tell about the university, its diversity and its improvement."
Players sense the uneasiness. "I don't think we worry about the stuff off the field too much. Stuff like this has been going on for a while around us," Hawk says as Michigan approaches. "But around the program, (as far as) the fans and everything ... a win here, I think, makes everyone in Columbus and Ohio sleep a little better."
If only for a night or two. Clarett, O'Brien, the NCAA — they're not going away soon.
No benefit of the doubt for Clarett 
Clarett is the biggest and most painful thorn, the freshman star of the 2002 team turned self-anointed whistle-blower. The question is how much, if anything, of what he's saying is true. 
He was suspended before his sophomore year when the NCAA looked into suspected rules violations, determined he had accepted thousands in improper extra benefits — mostly cell phone bills covered by a family friend — and further found him guilty of more than a dozen instances of misleading or lying to investigators.
The NCAA brought no charges against Ohio State. Clarett tried to sue his way into the NFL, ultimately failed and disappeared for a while, then resurfaced Nov. 9 in a story from ESPN The Magazine.
There, he whaled away at OSU. Clarett said he got improper academic assistance from a tutor. He said Tressel and his staff illicitly arranged loaner cars for him and steered him to summer jobs for which he was paid for little or no work. He boasted of thousands in handouts from boosters.
"If it was a different source, a really reliable person, everybody would be like, 'Maybe something is going on,' " Ohio State kicker Mike Nugent says. "With this kind of source, everyone is like, 'Who cares?' It happened before ... it'll be over soon."
That parallels the school's response. Athletics director Andy Geiger, in expressing complete confidence that Tressel and his staff are clean, is optimistic the NCAA will find no institutional impropriety. But the 43-year administrator is quick to caution, "I wouldn't say my expectation is that. I have learned the hard way that I don't know what I don't know, and there's no exemption from surprise."
Tressel, too, says, "What I know about, I feel good about."
Clarett's troubled past raises a credibility issue. But he threw just enough detail into the ESPN story to intrigue skeptics, describing, for example, how he would watch summer co-workers hang drywall, leave for a bite to eat at McDonald's and "make a couple grand." Ohio State counters that it has caught him in more lies.
Clarett maintained in the ESPN story that he rarely attended an African-American and African studies class, that he found it easy to cheat when he did and that "it was probably like a 40-person class and 30 of them were football players." 
Geiger says a check of the classes Clarett took found that, at most, 19% of the students in one were football players. "Otherwise, there were only about 7% football players in his classes, except for the several classes that he took where he was the only football player registered in the class."
Clarett almost certainly won't win a he-said, she-said exchange with the school. To act on his accusations, the NCAA would need witness corroboration, a paper trail or some other tangible proof.
Ohio State already has conducted an internal review of its academic support program, responding to a July 2003 story in The New York Times that said Clarett received "preferential" treatment at the school. No wrongdoing was found.
But in a separate story last week, former Ohio State running back Sammy Maldonado, now at Maryland, criticized the academic advising, saying that after two years he had only 17 credits that would transfer. He said he took courses such as remedial math, remedial reading, Tressel's Coaching Football and Issues Affecting Student Athletes. He admitted six credits wouldn't transfer because he earned D's. Without using names, Geiger said credits don't transfer for various reasons and that "the individuals (ESPN) selected as examples struggled, and I can't say more than that." 
Trouble seems to follow title winner 
Football isn't the only sport under NCAA investigation. In June, the widely respected O'Brien admitted he gave $6,000 to a foreign-born basketball recruit who wound up never playing for the Buckeyes, a clear violation for which he was summarily fired.
O'Brien's confession was prompted by mention of the payment in a local lawsuit that suggested other potential violations involving former player Boban Savovic. He was a member of the Ohio State team that reached the 1999 Final Four and, according to the suit, got cash, other monetary assistance and help with class work from a woman connected to two boosters.
"It's pretty straightforward. There are going to be sanctions," Geiger says. "How severe? I took a pretty bold step (in firing O'Brien), and hopefully we'll get some credit for that. But it's clear there are difficulties there. I'm not in denial over that."
Ohio State has been hit with major NCAA penalties only once, during the 1956-57 school year when the football and basketball programs had bans.
"If we're wrong, we're wrong," says Geiger, athletics director since 1994. "If there's something in the system that's rotten, then I shouldn't be here and I'm happy to go away. That goes with the territory. I don't lie awake at night worrying about that. I worry more about the university."
Ohio State's ill fortune since the 2002 title is familiar. Miami (Fla.), Washington, Alabama and Florida State landed on NCAA probation after football titles in the 1990s. Tennessee, though eventually cleared, waded through charges of academic fraud and improper payments to quarterback Tee Martin after winning in 1998.
Asked if the crystal trophy in the Hayes Center was worth the aggravation that followed it to Ohio State, Geiger is unequivocal. "That season was magic," he says. "In terms of what it meant for the school, what it meant for our alumni, what it meant for the kids who played — no matter what happens, they know what they did, they know what they accomplished — and for the coaching staff, sure it was worth it."
Maybe so, says Rall, in his 31st year on the Ohio State faculty. "Maybe if you want to be in the big time," he says, "these are the kinds of shots you have to take."
