The NBA has its own style, its own sense of imagery that relies heavily on individual player personalities. One of its most unique traits is the attention given to a player's walk through the bowels of the arena as he heads toward the locker room.It's commonly an opportunity for players to show off some stylish sneakers or eye-popping outfits -- or, in the case of James Harden prior to Wednesday night's Rockets-Bucks game, a chance to look like he just walked out of the "Field of Dreams":

Can't you imagine Harden, currently in the midst of another oustanding season for the Rockets, taking hacks with Shoeless Joe Jackson and the rest of the players from the classic film?
