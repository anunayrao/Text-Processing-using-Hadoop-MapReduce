Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham target Tonci Mujan has no intention of leaving Hajduk Split, according to the winger’s father.
Mujan’s performances in Croatia have caught the eye of all three Premier League sides, as well as Lazio and Napoli, who have also been trailing him.
But, after just 10 league appearances for Hajduk, the 18-year-old wants to continue to learn his trade there before thinking about upping sticks.
His father Nikola has revealed that clubs in England have already made moves to sign him – but insists his son is set to stay.
Nikola told Croatian newspaper Slobodna Dalmacija: “I have to admit that several English and Italian clubs are interested in him, but right now the will of the man is to stay in the Hajduk and improve as a player.”
