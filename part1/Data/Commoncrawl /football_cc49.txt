Manchester City can land an historic quadruple this season – IF they sign Bayern Munich defender Dante.
That’s the view of former Maine Road favourite Shaun Goater, who feels the Brazilian central defender could be the final peice in the City jigsaw.
The Blues breezed into the FA Cup fourth round with a 5-0 victory over Blackburn on Wednesday night, and have all but booked their place at Wembley for the Capital One Cup final following a 6-0 win in the first leg of their semi-final tie with West Ham.
City currently lead the way in the Premier League and face a last 16 Champions League tie with Barcelona next month, a challenge Manuel Pellegrini’s free-scoring side is surely relishing, as they set their sights on a four trophy haul.
The question mark against them this campaign has been a defensive frailty, particularly when captain Vincent Kompany is missing, but Goater claims the 30-year-old Brazilian could solve that problem.
“City need another quality centre-back and, if they get one, they would have all the pieces in the puzzle,” he told the Alan Brazil Sports Breakfast show. “They could get very close to winning all four trophies this season if they had that sort of squad.
“There is talk of them getting Dante from Bayern Munich, and I’d be really excited if they got him.”
