Hull have had an offer accepted for West Brom striker Shane Long and have been given permission to begin talks with the player.
The Tigers confirmed the club record signing of fellow forward Nikica Jelavic from Everton on Wednesday and less than 24 hours later made a breakthrough in their long-term pursuit of Long.
Jelavic cost an initial £6.5million rising to £7.5million should Hull stay in the Premier League, and Republic of Ireland international Long would cost them around £7million in a similarly-structured deal.
Sporting & Technical Director Richard Garlick said: “We began talking to Shane about a new contract last Spring and, during the ongoing negotiations, we made him two offers which would have significantly increased his salary.
“However, despite our best endeavours, Shane has declined to sign a new contract.
“Shane effectively only has 18 months left on his deal and with him no closer to accepting our terms and then Hull making an acceptable offer, we felt it was in the club’s best interests to accept the bid.”
