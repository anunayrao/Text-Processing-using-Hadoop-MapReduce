talkSPORT’s south coast correspondent Alex Crook says Mauricio Pochettino may still leave Southampton despite pledging his short-term future to the club.
The Argentine’s future was a source of huge speculation after chairman and close friend Nicola Cortese left the Saints following a disagreement with owner Katharina Liebherr. 
Crook said that Pochettino refused to confirm in his press conference whether he would see out the remaining 17 months of his contract and the journalist believes he could walk away from the club this summer.
The south coast expert added that he expects bids for the likes of Luke Shaw  to come in with Cortese now gone and that if Southampton’s stars are sold then Pochettino would consider his future before the end of January.
