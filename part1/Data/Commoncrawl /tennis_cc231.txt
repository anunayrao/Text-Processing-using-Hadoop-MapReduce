Ladies, do you ever open your drawer of unmentionables and think, "I wish I could wear intimate garments that made me feel like the No. 9 tennis player in the world?" If so, then news of Caroline Wozniacki's upcoming underwear collection is like a dream fulfilled.
The former No. 1 announced Monday that she was partnering with a Danish clothier to release a line of lifestyle and leisure underwear. Her "This is Me" line will be released worldwide in September. It includesÂ low hipsters, g-strings and bras. The undergarments were designed with "Caroline's personal input to reflect her individual style and desired level of comfort."
"A feminine lifestyle/leisure underwear collection for the girl that wants the good looks from fashion, a perfect fit for her body, and a quality that's hard to beat," Wozniacki said in a press release that was certainly not written by a public relations firm. "JBS was the perfect partner to accomplish that."
You know how sometimes your brain gets overloaded because there are limitless possibilities for comebacks and quips? When that usually happens, I find myself putting on the "Oxygen" video and losing myself in the music. That didn't work in this case.
