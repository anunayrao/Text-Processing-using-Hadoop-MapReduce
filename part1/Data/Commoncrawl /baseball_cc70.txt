As part of our commitment to help and support children in our community, Cardinals Care has built or renovated 23 youth baseball fields throughout the St. Louis metropolitan area. Most recently, the Cardinals dedicated Dexter Fowler Field at Hess Park in Decatur, IL in July, 2017.
Building ball fields and establishing baseball leagues gives youth the opportunity to learn to play ball and instills the importance of giving back. As a result, thousands of children now have a safe and suitable place to practice and play!
