2017 has been a terrific year for tennis tragics, with Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer sharing the spoils from all four major tournaments.

However this begs the question, when will the next crop of tennis superstars break through?

Nadal (number one) and Federer (number two) now occupy the top two rankings, the first time this has occurred since 2011.
At 31 and 36 respectively, Nadal and Federer are the oldest combined top two tennis players in the world since 1973.
Are the best getting better with age? Or is the depth of our male tennis stars severely scarce?
It's a point to discuss when you factor in how dominant the big four (Federer, Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray) have been over the past decade and longer.
46 out of the last 51 grand slam champions have been one of the big four, with only three other players claiming a grand slam title since 2006.
These three are Juan Martin del Potro, Marin Cilic and Stan Wawrinka. 
The last time a player outside the big four was world number one was Andy Roddick, in February 2004.
That was 711 weeks ago!
Where are the young guns?
All may not be so dire, with 20-year old Alexander Zverev currently ranked number four in the world.
He recently beat Federer in the final of the Canadian Masters in August, however Zverev failed to take his form into the US Open and was beaten in the second round.
The next youngest player in the top 20 is Australia's Nick Kyrgios.
Whilst Kyrgios clearly has the talent, is remains to be seen whether he has the appropriate temperament to maintain a long and successful career.
Where are the young guns?
Lets hope Roger and Rafa keep going for another decade so we don't have to answer this question.
