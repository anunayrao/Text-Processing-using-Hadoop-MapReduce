A recent figure by Sky Sports News in the UK showed just how much ground athletes in different sports cover over the course of a match or day's play.

We sniffed around for some more data to bring you this list of sport's biggest metre eaters.
Slide on for the results.
A hard-working NBA starter will cover around four kilometres per game. Bulls Guard Jimmy Butler is one of the league's fittest players, averaging about 4.3 kms a game.
Obviously this changes a lot depending on an individual's play style and the length of match. John Isner and Nicolas Mahut are estimated to have covered nearly 10km in their marathon match at Wimbledon in 2010.
International rugby players cover about 7kms per match with backs getting through slightly more work than the big men.
League players aren't too far away from their 15-man cousins. Halfbacks peak at around 8.5 kms per game with forwards notching up about six.
The average outfield player will cover around 10 kms in a game, though some midfielders have notched as much as 15 kms in 90 minutes.
The average has come down in the last few years as teams rotated through the bench more, but with the introduction of the interchange cap, it is likely to rise again.
A busy fast bowler is obviously on the upper end of the scale but it is not uncommon for them to cover such distances in a day's play. Mitchell Johnson notched up 23 kms on the first day of the 2013 Boxing Day Test.
