Odell Beckham Jr. is one of the only things in football that I remotely care about, so him getting traded from NYC to Cleveland was pretty jarring (Noah Syndergaard agrees). He's one of the most entertaining and transcendent talents football has ever seen and also has an extremely captivating and endearing off-the-field persona.
But one of the biggest knocks on the dude peddled by members of the grouchy section of the NFL media squadron, is that Beckham can be a bit of a me-first, showoff-type player. Fair or not (personally I think it's unfair) this narrative has stuck to him and many people see him as a hot dog.
The Akron Rubberducks, the Double-A affiliate of the Cleveland Indians, saw OBJ's trade to the region as an opportunity to unveil a new food item inspired by the polarizing pass catcher.

The Louisiana hot sauce is a hat tip to OBJ's roots in the southern state and his time at LSU, while the onion-bacon-jalepeno relish looks like a delicious, acronym-inspired concoction. It's unclear how many Eastern League games Beckham will get to this season, but if he does make it down to Canal Park in Akron (awesome stadium if you ever get the chance) hopefully he'll try out one of his own meat treats.
