In one of the most shocking, and noisy, upsets in recent memory, Michelle Larcher de Brito knocked off Maria Sharapova, 6-3, 6-4.
But the athleticism on display wasn't the topic of conversation; the hyperactive, ultrasonic screaming was. Both players shouted like they were being stabbed on every point. Is it fair or sporting? Opinions vary, but it's painful to watch, and it takes away from the true skill of the players. Here, just listen to the final points:
Larcher de Brito is ranked 131st in the world. Sharapova was seeded second in the tournament, and appeared to have a clear path at least to the finals. But it wasn't to be, as she was outplayed at every turn. Sharapova did slip several times on the Wimbledon grass, receiving treatment on the sidelines, and at one point appeared to indicate to the umpire that the court was "dangerous."
After the match, Sharapova offered a possible reason for her footing problems. "There's lot of grass that's been cut and not been swept up so there's a lot of dead grass so it's not been easy," Sharapova told the BBC. "It's a tough court to play on."
According to ESPN Stats & Info, this was Sharapova's third loss to a player ranked 100th or above in a Grand Slam, and the first since 2008. Along with Rafael Nadal's sudden defeat in the first round on Monday and Victoria Azarenka's withdrawal on Wednesday, this Wimbledon is fast losing some of its marquee attractions.
