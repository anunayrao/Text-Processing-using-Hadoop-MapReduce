After their 5-0 win over Blackburn in the FA Cup, Manchester City have now racked up 99 goals so far this season in all competitions and could be set to break all manner of records.
Under Manuel Pellegrini, the Blues’ free-flowing style of play has seen their strikers Sergio Aguero, Alvaro Negredo and Edin Dzeko find the back of the net 56 times in total, while Yaya Toure, once regarded as a defensive midfielder, has weighed in with 13 strikes.
City’s 99 strikes have come in just 33 matches, meaning they will shatter the record set by Chelsea in 2010, when the London club become the fastest top flight English side to 100 goals in all competitions in the post-1992 Premier League era, scoring a century in 42 games under Carlo Ancelotti.
And as the 2012 Premier League champions begin dreaming of winning the quadruple, so good is their form, talkSPORT looks at the legendary sides whose goal tallies Man City could soon be passing (take a look at the gallery above).
