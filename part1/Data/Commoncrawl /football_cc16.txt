West Ham are turning to Genoa striker Alberto Gilardino in a bid to solve their goal-scoring problems, according to reports in Italy.
The Hammers are still eager to sign a striker, despite Andy Carroll returning to fitness and Carlton Cole signing another short-term contract.
Sam Allardyce tried to grab Italian Gilardino on loan in the summer but a deal could not be done. However, forzaitaliana.com claim the east London side have resurrected their interest in the former AC Milan man.
Gilardino was recently offered the chance to link up with Jermain Defoe at Toronto FC but he rejected the deal proposed by the MLS side.
The 31-year-old has scored eight goals in 18 Serie A appearances so far this season and has netted 19 times for Italy during his international career.
