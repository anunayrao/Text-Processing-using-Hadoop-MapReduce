Every weeknight, from 10pm-1am UK time, football fans of all club colours call Andy Goldstein’s Sports Bar show on talkSPORT to have their say on what matters to them.
This week, Andy – joined by journalist and Arsenal supporter Matt Scott – took calls from Gunners fans with differing views on the direction the club is taking.
On the one side was Arsenal supporter Femi, a self-described “optimist” who’s “feeling great about the new season” and believes the club will challenge on all fronts.
“It’s not about [signing] marquee names, it’s who you bring through,” Femi explained on talkSPORT. 
“I admire Arsene’s philosophy of bringing unknown players [in] and mixing that with youngsters.
“When you get the right balance you can achieve success.”
In contrast, fellow Arsenal fan Valentine complained that “it’s becoming embarrassing. The season hasn’t even started yet and I don’t even want to watch Arsenal.
“It’s the same old, same old, for 12 years.”
