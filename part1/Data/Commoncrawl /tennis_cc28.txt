The third seed at the tournament, Gavrilova made a number of errors to hand seventh-seed Tsurenko a relatively routine path to the final.

Though showing some late resolve in the match, as the 23-year-old Aussie survived six match points and won four straight games, she'd eventually fall in her quest to make the decider.

Tsurenko, who won the tournament last year, will now face either Stefanie VÃ¶gele or Rebecca Peterson in the final as Gavrilova rues a missed opportunity to pick up a title. 
Gavrilova had earlier made headlines during the tournament when she threw her racquet in anger with a nearby ballboy only just avoiding being hit.
Nick Kyrgios noted at the time on Twitter that if he had done something similar he would 'be banned for 6 years and been on every paper and news channel for the next month'.
