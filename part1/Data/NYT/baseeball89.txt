Larry Baer will take a leave of absence from his job as the chief executive of the San Francisco Giants, the team announced on Monday. Last week, Mr. Baer was captured on video in a physical altercation with his wife in a public plaza that ended with her on the ground.
The Giants said that Mr. Baer “has acknowledged that his behavior was unacceptable, apologized to the organization, and is committed to taking steps to make sure that this never happens again.”
The Giants said that its executive team would manage day-to-day operations during Mr. Baer’s absence.
Major League Baseball has said it is gathering facts on the altercation.
The Giants said in their statement that they would cooperate.
In the video, Mr. Baer is seen lunging for something in his wife’s hands. The couple said later that it was a cellphone. In the struggle, Mrs. Baer falls off her chair and onto the ground.
In a statement after the video emerged on Friday, the couple said: “Regrettably today we had a heated argument in public over a family matter. We are deeply embarrassed by the situation and have resolved the issue.”
Mrs. Baer said in a statement: “I started to get up, and the chair I was sitting in began to tip. Due to an injury I sustained in my foot three days ago, I lost my balance. I did not sustain any injury based on what happened today. Larry and I always have been and still are happily married.”
The length of the leave of absence and Mr. Baer’s future with the club are unclear. The club said, “As leaders in the community, we at the Giants hold ourselves to the highest standards and those standards will guide how we consider this matter moving forward.”
Mr. Baer was named chief operating officer of the Giants in 1996, president in 2008 and chief executive in 2012.
