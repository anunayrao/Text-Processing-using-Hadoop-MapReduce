SPRAGUE, Conn. â€” A bobcat that attacked a golfer in Connecticut was beaten off by golf clubs before environmental police tracked it down and killed it, authorities said.
The bobcat attacked the golfer at about 8:30 a.m. Thursday on the Mohegan Sun Golf Course in the Baltic section of Sprague, according to a statement from the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.
General manager Philip Krick Jr. told The Day of New London a foursome was near a fairway bunker on the seventh hole when the cat jumped on one man's back. Krick and police said the man in his 60s and another golfer in his group used their clubs to beat the cat away.
Environmental police tracked the cat to a culvert and shot it. The bobcat is thought to be the same animal that attacked a horse stabled nearby earlier in the morning. The horse received lacerations to the neck and eye and was treated by a veterinarian.
The bobcat is being tested for rabies.
The golfer was taken to a Norwich hospital to be treated for scratches. His name was not made public.
Bobcats are common in Connecticut, but they tend to be secretive animals and attacks on humans are rare, state officials said. The last report of a bobcat attack in the state was in Bozrah in August 2014. That animal turned out to be rabid.
