Kansas junior forward Dedric Lawson announced Monday that he is declaring for the NBA draft.
The third-team All-American averaged 19.4 points and 10.3 rebounds this season, and his 22 double-doubles were third most in Jayhawks' history.
Lawson announced his decision in a note on Twitter.
"After prayer and discussion with my family, I will pursue my life's dream by declaring for the NBA draft," he wrote. "I will begin my preparation for the NBA immediately. RockChalk JayHawk for Life!!"
Jayhawks coach Bill Self indicated he was on board with Lawson's decision to enter the draft.
"Dedric informed me shortly after the season of his intentions to declare for the NBA Draft," Self said in a statement. "He had a chance to go home and visit with family about this and we totally support his decision and wish him nothing but the best moving forward. ...
"He could not have represented our program, the university or his family any better than how he did. All Jayhawk fans should be excited for him."
Lawson's brother, K.J., announced late last week that he will transfer from Kansas. K.J. Lawson, a swingman, averaged 3.1 points and 2.0 rebounds and will have two seasons remaining.
Sophomore guard Charlie Moore also is transferring. He averaged 2.9 points and 1.3 assists this past season.
