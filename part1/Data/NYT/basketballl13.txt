Kentucky standout sophomore PJ Washington declared for the NBA Draft on Tuesday and will hire an agent, the school announced.
"This place has been my home for two years and it's hard for me to put in words how much I've grown in my time at Kentucky. The staff challenged me from day one to become the best version of myself and to work hard to become one of the best players in college basketball. I feel like I've done that," Washington said in a statement posted on the Wildcats' website.
The 6-foot-8 forward ends his career with 932 points, 476 rebounds 120 assists and 74 blocks. He led the Wildcats in scoring (15.2) and rebounding (7.5) this past season. He also posted nine double-doubles and shot 52.2 percent from the floor, including 42.3 percent from the 3-point line.
Washington earned first team All-SEC and third team All-America honors.
"PJ transformed everything about his game. He became a national player of the year candidate, he showed his full set of his skills and he improved his stock while helping us become one of the best teams in the country," Kentucky coach John Calipari said.
Washington is projected to be a mid-first-round pick by ESPN.
